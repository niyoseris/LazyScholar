# Popularity vs. Preference

### Defining Music Preference: Popularity vs. Preference

Music preference is a form of self-expression and identity. Individual tastes determine the amount of pleasure people derive from goods and services, including music (Author, Year). Consumer preferences reveal how a consumer would rank different options, assuming they are available at no cost (Author, Year). Utility functions measure the level of satisfaction a consumer receives, providing a ranking of preferences, although the magnitude of utility differences is not comparable across individuals (Author, Year). Utility functions are a convenient way to represent ordinal preference relations, but the cardinal values of utility are not meant to signify anything beyond representing these preferences (Author, Year). A utility function is an "as if" model, where people behave as if they were maximizing a particular function, given their constraints (Author, Year). Preferences are considered the true underlying primitive that people "have," while utility functions are an "as-if" model (Author, Year).

Distinguishing between popularity and preference is crucial in understanding musical taste. Predicting song popularity is important in the music industry, with implications for businesses (Author, Year). Understanding what makes a song popular can be applied to predicting preferred songs (Author, Year). However, the quality of a song only partially influences its popularity; social influence plays a significant role (Author, Year). One study analyzes trends in popular music genres using the Billboard Hot 100 as a measure of consumer preference and the Village Voice Pazz & Jop criticsâ€™ polls as a measure of genre preferences among critics (Author, Year). The Billboard Hot 100 measures popularity among the general public based on sales, airtime, and streaming (Author, Year). The study examines the association between consumer and critics' preferences over time, including the decline of Rock in both consumer and critical appeal (Author, Year). The Echo Nest provides a "song hotttnesss" metric of popularity, based on activity on websites, classifying songs in the top 25% as popular (Author, Year).
