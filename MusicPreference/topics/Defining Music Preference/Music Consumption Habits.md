# Music Consumption Habits

### Music Consumption Habits

Recent research has focused on the evolving landscape of music consumption, particularly concerning the impact of streaming services and generational differences. Several studies highlight the shift from durable music formats (physical and digital) to non-durable streaming options, noting that while streaming offers access to a vast library, access is contingent upon maintaining a subscription (Author, Year). This transition has implications for cultural omnivorousness, with one study using survey data (n=251) collected in early 2022 to examine whether the accessibility of music streaming has led to omnivorousness across different social classes (Author, Year). This research investigates listener profiles, differentiating between premium and freemium users, and analyzes their listening habits and perceptions of data accuracy (Author, Year).

Furthermore, generational differences in music consumption are a key area of inquiry. One study compares the consuming and purchasing habits of Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation, using randomized surveys conducted in three western states (Author, Year). Employing social cognitive theory, the study explores the relationship between engagement levels and Millennials' music consumption habits, revealing significant differences in listening habits (duration, platform, and mode), willingness to pay for music, and the influence of advertisements (Author, Year). Given that Millennials are "digital natives," technology plays a significant role in their music consumption patterns (Author, Year).

Beyond individual preferences and generational trends, external factors and cultural events also influence music consumption. One study analyzes data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart and Google Trends to identify correlations between major cultural events and shifts in listening habits in the United States (Author, Year). This research explores whether specific events have altered listening habits as a reaction to them and considers the role of platforms like YouTube (Author, Year). Finally, research also explores how social media data can reveal details of usersâ€™ musical tastes, examining music consumption in relation to demographics and socioeconomic information (Author, Year). By analyzing data from platforms like Last.fm and inferring socioeconomic information from Twitter, researchers aim to build profiles of users' musical consumption and understand the relationship between musical diversity and socioeconomic factors (Author, Year).
