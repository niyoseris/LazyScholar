# Subjective Music Taste Measurement

### Subjective Music Taste Measurement

The measurement of music preference is fundamentally rooted in subjective experience. Music similarity, for instance, is an intrinsically subjective concept that varies across individuals, time, mood, and context (Author, Year). Human opinion is considered the final arbiter of music similarity, yet subjective judgments of similarity between artists are not consistent between listeners and can change over time (Author, Year). This inherent subjectivity makes establishing a definitive ground truth for music similarity challenging (Author, Year).

One approach to address this challenge is to capture an 'average' consensus of music taste (Author, Year). This involves unifying various sources of subjective opinion into a "consensus truth" for music similarity (Author, Year). Subjective similarity can be determined using sources of human opinion mined from the Web, such as data from The All Music Guide, surveys, playlists, and personal collections (Author, Year). These diverse sources of subjective measures show reasonable agreement, with the measure derived from co-occurrence in personal music collections being the most reliable overall (Author, Year). Furthermore, subjective data sources are likely to uncover relationships not easily discerned by machine (Author, Year).

While current methods often analyze musical tone as acoustical phenomena, it remains uncertain whether the measured aspects are primary in auditory perception (Author, Year). A correlation between observations and ear judgment is needed, requiring scientist-musician cooperation (Author, Year). The qualitative vocabulary of music leads to individual subjectivism based on personal taste, highlighting the need for a quantitative vocabulary, developed through scientific techniques, to measure qualities of music (Author, Year). Given the intrinsically subjective nature of music similarity, it is difficult to decide which similarity technique is best suited for the task at hand (Author, Year). Therefore, researchers are encouraged to make their distilled datasets publicly available so that algorithms can be compared on the same data (Author, Year). A way to use subjective judgments about music similarity mined from the Internet as a collective soft ground truth is proposed (Author, Year).
