# Political Party Affiliation

### Political Party Affiliation

Political party affiliation is a key indicator of political views and a central element in citizens' political belief systems (Author, Year). This affiliation represents an emotional attachment to a political party rooted in the social images of the parties (Author, Year). Individuals often decide which party to identify with based on their feelings about the social groups that comprise the party base (Author, Year). This identification is a stable predisposition that shapes political perceptions and remains largely unaffected by those perceptions (Author, Year). In fact, party identification is often more stable than core political values, and it constrains beliefs about issues such as equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance (Author, Year).

Partisanship has become a salient social identity, influencing party choices and triggering positive feelings for the in-group and negative evaluations of the out-group (Author, Year). Stronger loyalty to a party leads to more divergent beliefs and increased inter-group polarization (Author, Year). This partisan affect has become increasingly salient in American politics, influencing behaviors and leading partisans to express negative sentiments toward opposing groups, creating social distance (Author, Year). The psychological underpinnings of party identification are more affective than ideological, with partisans viewing opponents as a stigmatized out-group (Author, Year). This partisan negativity has risen since the 1980s (Author, Year).

Examining specific demographic groups reveals nuances within party affiliation. A 2020 report indicated that 50% of registered LGBT voters identify as Democrats, 15% as Republicans, and 22% as Independents (Author, Year). Notably, only 2% of transgender people identify as Republicans (Author, Year). A study focusing on non-transgender LGB individuals found differences between Republican and Democratic LGB people in their feelings about their sexual identity and relationship to the LGBT community (Author, Year). Compared with Democratic LGB people, fewer Republican LGB people said that being LGB is a very important aspect of their life, and more Republican LGB people said they would want to be completely heterosexual (Author, Year). Furthermore, Republican LGB people were less likely than Democratic LGB people to feel a part of the LGBT community (Author, Year).

Voter registration data provides further insight into party affiliation. As of November 1, 2023, Kansas had a total of 1,954,355 registered voters, with 506,640 registered as Democrats, 24,088 as Libertarians, 869,391 as Republicans, and 554,236 as unaffiliated (Author, Year). County-level data reveals variations across the state; for example, Allen County has 1,386 registered Democrats, 103 Libertarians, 4,583 Republicans, and 2,626 unaffiliated voters, while Johnson County has 147,141 registered Democrats, 5,764 Libertarians, 187,568 Republicans, and 115,402 unaffiliated voters (Author, Year).

Understanding the dynamics of party affiliation requires considering the factors that influence an individual's transition through different levels of political interest (Author, Year). A mathematical model can represent this transition, classifying individuals into states such as Undecided/Apathetic/Other, Mildly Supportive of Party A (Moderate Democrat), Strongly Supportive of Party A (Fanatical Democrat), Mildly Supportive of Party B (Moderate Republican), and Strongly Supportive of Party B (Fanatical Republican) (Author, Year). These classifications are based on an individual's level of support and activity in promoting a candidate, influenced by personal factors such as religious values, socio-economic status, family upbringing, and cultural values, as well as interactions with others (Author, Year).
