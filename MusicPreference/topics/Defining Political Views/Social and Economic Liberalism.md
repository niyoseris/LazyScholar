### Social and Economic Liberalism

Liberalism, at its core, is rooted in principles of individual freedom and rationality, emphasizing the importance of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (Author, Year). Modern democratic liberalism builds upon this foundation, rejecting *laissez-faire* economics while upholding constitutional liberalism (Author, Year). A central tenet is the equal right to freedom, encompassing civil and political liberties, alongside the basic requirements for human development and security to ensure equal opportunity and personal dignity (Author, Year). This necessitates responsibilities for both individuals and the government to foster conditions conducive to success for all (Author, Year).

Liberal systems of resource allocation are predicated on the political economy of freedom, assuming individuals are rational, self-interested, and prioritize freedom (Author, Year). This framework posits that free and rational actors naturally create markets, characterized by non-coerced exchange, private property, and a division of labor (Author, Year). These markets operate through supply, demand, and price mechanisms, aiming for efficiency, growth, welfare, and peace (Author, Year). While inequality may arise, it is often tolerated due to the belief that overall growth benefits everyone (Author, Year).

Embedded liberalism emerged as a post-World War II compromise, seeking to reconcile markets with societal needs (Author, Year). This approach contrasts with both the economic nationalism of the 1930s and the "disembedded" markets of classical liberalism, which were deemed politically unsustainable (Author, Year). Embedded liberalism involves domestic interventionism to mitigate the socially disruptive effects of markets while preserving the benefits of trade (Author, Year). The core principle is legitimizing international markets by aligning them with social values and shared institutional practices (Author, Year).

However, the rise of neoliberalism has challenged this compromise, leading to a crisis of legitimacy for globalization (Author, Year). Neoliberalism, a revised form of classical economic liberalism, advocates for market relations to govern within and between states (Author, Year). As a political ideology, it favors market allocation over public provision, lower taxes, weakened labor unions, deregulation, and reduced public spending, while embracing formal democracy and the rule of law (Author, Year). This contrasts with Keynesianism, social democracy, and other models that prioritize state intervention (Author, Year). The neoliberal social imaginary promotes entrepreneurship, self-reliance, individualism, and equates self-interest with freedom (Author, Year).
