### Social and Economic Conservatism

Political ideology is often conceptualized as a spectrum, ranging from liberal to conservative, encompassing both social and economic dimensions (Author, Year). Conservative ideology, in general, emphasizes resistance to change and the justification of existing inequalities, often driven by a need to manage uncertainty and perceived threats (Author, Year). Psychological factors such as dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, and the avoidance of uncertainty are significant contributors to understanding political conservatism (Author, Year). In fact, research suggests a correlation between conservatism and "black-and-white" thinking, with this cognitive style being a stronger predictor of social conservatism than economic conservatism (Author, Year).

Needs for security and certainty (NSC) are closely linked to conservative ideologies (Author, Year). Aversion to novelty and complexity, alongside a preference for conformity, obedience, order, and a heightened concern for security, are characteristic of right-wing ideologies (Author, Year). These NSC characteristics may predict both cultural and economic conservatism (Author, Year). Right-wing economic policies typically involve support for free markets, private economic activity, and opposition to redistributive policies (Author, Year). This aligns with the conservative emphasis on upholding traditional societal arrangements and resource allocations, appealing to individuals with strong needs for security and certainty (Author, Year).

Social conservatism is particularly concerned with issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and gun ownership (Author, Year). Religious conservatives, often referred to as the Religious Right, are a significant force in social conservatism, fueled by evangelical institutions (Author, Year). The Religious Right has been influential in American politics, particularly within the Republican Party, utilizing various tactics, including television programs, to promote conservative values (Author, Year). Movements like the Moral Majority, composed of evangelical Christians, aimed to increase Christian influence in American politics (Author, Year). It is important to note that conservatism, particularly in its right-wing populist form, is sometimes conflated with populism, which appeals to grievances related to demographic and cultural change and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics (Author, Year). Populism involves an anti-elite and pro-people stance, coupled with suspicion towards political institutions (Author, Year).
