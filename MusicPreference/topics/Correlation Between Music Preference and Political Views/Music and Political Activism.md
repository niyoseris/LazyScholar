# Music and Political Activism

### Music as a Catalyst for Political Activism

Music has historically served as a powerful medium for expressing political views and mobilizing social movements. During the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, gospel, spirituals, folk music, and popular genres like jazz, blues, and rock nâ€™ roll were instrumental in both protest and solidarity (Center for Popular Music). Artists across genres supported the movement and fought for equality in the music industry (Center for Popular Music). For example, jazz musicians of this era protested injustice towards Black Americans and expressed solidarity for civil rights through their music (Author, Year). However, their contributions as activists are often overlooked outside of formal affiliations with organizations like the NAACP or SNCC (Author, Year). One study analyzes how jazz musicians participated informally in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements through the reception of their music (Author, Year). The wide public reception of jazz protest music led organizations to enlist musicians to reach a wider audience (Author, Year). Some white musicians stood up for their Black colleagues, like Artie Shaw, who canceled a tour when told to fire a Black trumpet player (Author, Year). Conversely, Nat "King" Cole was assaulted on stage for having an integrated band (Author, Year). Despite these contributions, literature on the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements often makes little reference to musicians and performers as public figures who aided organization within these movements (Author, Year).

The potent intersection of music and political activism is further highlighted by the course "Politics and Protest in American Musical History," which explores musical responses to key historical events, examining both mainstream and radical musical reactions to political activism (Author, Year). The course considers how music expresses political ideas through patriotism and protest, including music about race, class, gender, poverty, and oppression, as well as anti-establishment sentiments (Author, Year). Genres like folk, popular, and classical music were analyzed for their political themes, such as union songs, anti-war countercultures, punk's anarchic stance, and themes of racial inequality in jazz (Author, Year).

Contemporary movements, such as Black Lives Matter, also recognize the power of music as a political tool. A recent conference explored the role of music, musicians, and sound within the Black Lives Matter movement, examining music's potential in the context of police brutality and mass incarceration (Author, Year). The conference sought to understand how music can move beyond documentation to establish a basis for structural progress and principled resistance, inviting submissions on themes including sonic violence, crowd control, protest, civil and human rights, and the role of celebrity in popular music (Author, Year).
