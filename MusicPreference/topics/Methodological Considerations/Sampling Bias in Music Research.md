# Sampling Bias in Music Research

## Methodological Considerations: Sampling Bias in Music Research

Sampling bias, a pervasive concern in empirical research, arises when certain members of the intended population are less likely to be included in the sample than others, resulting in a non-random representation (Author, Year). This can lead to over- or underrepresentation of parameters in the population, and if unaddressed, can result in erroneously attributing results to the phenomenon under study rather than the sampling method itself (Author, Year). Indeed, almost every sample is biased to some degree (Author, Year). Types of sampling bias include selection from a specific real area (e.g., surveying only high school students), pre-screening of trial participants, exclusion bias (excluding specific groups), healthy user bias, Berkson's fallacy, and overmatching (Author, Year). Historical examples, such as the Literary Digest's 1936 presidential election poll that oversampled wealthy individuals and the Chicago Tribune's 1948 election headline based on a phone survey (biased due to limited phone ownership), illustrate the potential for skewed results (Author, Year).

One specific type of sampling bias, self-selection bias, is particularly relevant in studies where participants have control over their participation, as their decision may correlate with traits affecting the study (Author, Year). Online and phone-in polls are prime examples of self-selection bias (Author, Year). This concern is pertinent to the analysis of musical influence networks using data from WhoSampled.com, a music website that chronicles sampling behavior via a community of contributors (Author, Year). While the dataset, consisting of user-generated records of sampling (excluding cover songs), is assumed to be a good representation of sampling behavior in modern popular music, the potential for bias due to its user-generated nature is acknowledged (Author, Year). The general shape of the destination material may reflect the increased popularity of sampling and/or listener trends within the WhoSampled.com user community (Author, Year).

Furthermore, evaluator bias can impact the fairness of music performance assessment (Author, Year). This study utilizes a dataset from the Florida Bandmasters Association (FBA) of all-state auditions, containing recordings of student performances from middle school, concert band, and symphonic band students playing 19 types of instruments (Author, Year). Each audition exercise is graded by experts on categories like musicality, note accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, tone quality, artistry, and articulation (Author, Year). While the dataset offers valuable insights, the study acknowledges that the recordings may be subject to sampling bias (Author, Year). To mitigate potential bias, the study focuses on a subset of the dataset, specifically alto sax and snare drum performances by middle school students, due to their relatively higher number of recordings (Author, Year), although this selection may introduce its own form of selection bias (Author, Year).

In a separate analysis of frequency-based biases (conformity and novelty) influencing the adoption of musical variants, music sampling serves as a suitable model because samples are culturally transmitted and documented in online databases (Author, Year). This study employs longitudinal sampling data to determine if frequency-based bias plays a role in the cultural transmission of music sampling traditions (Author, Year). The analysis focuses on drum breaks sampled between 1987 and 2018, as artists typically use only one drum break per composition, whereas vocal and instrumental samples are combined more flexibly (Author, Year). To better capture temporal dynamics and address the susceptibility of earlier approaches to type I and II errors, the study utilizes turn-over rates and generative inference (Author, Year). Agent-based modeling is also employed to simulate cultural transmission with parameters for innovation rate and frequency-based bias (Author, Year).
