### Methodological Considerations

#### Data Analysis Techniques

This research employs a variety of data analysis techniques, encompassing database management, exploratory data analysis (EDA), panel data analysis, methods for large-scale datasets, machine learning, and multivariate statistics. Databases are utilized for storing, managing, and querying data, with basic operations including filtering, sorting, aggregating, joining, and composing operations (Author, Year).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) serves as a critical initial step, involving methods that examine data without formal statistical modeling and inference (Author, Year). EDA techniques are classified as either non-graphical or graphical, and univariate or multivariate. Univariate methods analyze single variables, while multivariate methods examine relationships between two or more variables (Author, Year). Univariate non-graphical EDA for categorical variables involves tabulating frequencies and calculating proportions, while for quantitative variables, it involves calculating sample statistics to estimate population parameters such as measures of central tendency, spread, skewness, and kurtosis (Author, Year).

Panel data analysis is employed to analyze data collected at multiple time points for the same units (Author, Year). Estimation techniques for panel models include Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) (Author, Year). Strategies to address endogeneity bias include instrumental variables estimation, structural equations models, propensity score estimation, and fixed effects panel models (Author, Year). Strategies to address correlated errors include cluster-consistent covariance matrix estimators and Generalized Least Squares (Author, Year).

Given the potential for large-scale datasets, this research also considers methods designed for faster speed and higher efficiency (Author, Year). These include divide and conquer methods, which involve dividing the original dataset into smaller blocks, performing statistical analysis on each block, and then combining the results (Author, Year). The challenge lies in providing strategies for combining the results from smaller blocks, which is trivial for some models, like linear models or generalized linear models, for which the estimation procedures are linear by construction (Author, Year).

Furthermore, machine learning techniques are utilized to make inferences and predictions from large datasets (Author, Year). These techniques include regression (deciding output value based on input values), classification (deciding category based on features), clustering (creating groups of similar items), and anomaly detection (finding items that donâ€™t conform to pattern) (Author, Year). Specific algorithms considered include simple linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree classifiers, k-means clustering, and Naive Bayes (Author, Year).

Finally, multivariate statistics are employed to examine how columns of data covary, using covariances to evaluate dependencies (Author, Year). Exploratory analyses include projection methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Coordinate Analysis/Multidimensional Scaling (PCO/MDS), Correspondence Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, and tree-based methods (Author, Year). PCA simplifies data by rank reduction, rescaling data for equal standard deviation, and centering columns (Author, Year). Visualization tools such as boxplots, barplots, scatterplots, hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, and phylogenies are also utilized (Author, Year).
