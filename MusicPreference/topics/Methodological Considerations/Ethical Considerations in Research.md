#### Ethical Considerations in Research

Ethics in research are defined as the norms for conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior (Author, Year). These norms are broader and more informal than laws, and research ethics is a specialized discipline dedicated to studying these norms (Author, Year). Adherence to ethical norms promotes knowledge, truth, and the avoidance of error (Author, Year). Ethical standards foster trust, accountability, mutual respect, and fairness in collaborative work, ensuring researchers are accountable to the public and building public support for research (Author, Year). Furthermore, ethical norms promote social responsibility, human rights, animal welfare, compliance with the law, and health and safety (Author, Year). Ethical lapses can harm human and animal subjects, students, and the public (Author, Year). To address these concerns, many professional associations, government agencies, and universities have adopted codes, rules, and policies relating to research ethics (Author, Year). Examples of ethical principles include honesty, objectivity, integrity, carefulness, openness, respect for intellectual property, confidentiality, responsible publication, responsible mentoring, respect for colleagues, social responsibility, non-discrimination, competence, legality, and animal care (Author, Year).

Research ethics encompasses both personal and institutional morality, applying not only to individual researchers and research managers but also to bodies that exert influence on research and its consequences (Author, Year). The obligation to respect research ethics is part of the overall responsibility for research, shared by individual researchers, project managers, research institutions, and appropriating authorities (Author, Year). Key principles include respect for human dignity, integrity, freedom, and participation (Author, Year). Researchers must avoid causing injury or severe burdens, inform research subjects, and obtain free and informed consent (Author, Year). Adherence to research licenses and reporting obligations is also essential (Author, Year). Respect for privacy, confidentiality, and restrictions on the re-use of data are crucial, requiring secure storage of identifiable information (Author, Year). Ethical considerations extend to posthumous reputations, values, and motives of others, necessitating that researchers clearly define their roles (Author, Year). Regard for disadvantaged groups is necessary, along with scientific integrity and good reference practices (Author, Year). The student-supervisor relationship and responsibilities of supervisors/project managers must also be addressed (Author, Year). Science communication requires specialized skills and carries obligations for individuals and institutions, with researchers bearing responsibility for how their research is interpreted and conveyed effectively (Author, Year).

When collecting data from community members, ethical considerations are paramount (Author, Year). Key principles include enhancing health/knowledge (value), methodological soundness (scientific validity), fair subject selection, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, informed consent, and respect for subjects (privacy, withdrawal option, well-being) (Author, Year). Trust is the cornerstone of ethical research, and the head researcher is responsible for ethical performance and subject protection (Author, Year). Special care is needed for vulnerable subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, the mentally disabled, the economically/educationally disadvantaged, the terminally ill, students, and employees (Author, Year). Research with human subjects is defined as a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, where a human subject is a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data or identifiable private information (Author, Year). Potential risks include physical, psychological, social, or economic harm (Author, Year). Social risks involve disclosure leading to stigmatization/discrimination, psychological harms include stress, depression, and guilt, and economic risks involve negative impacts on employment/insurance (Author, Year). Physical harms can occur when exploring sensitive topics (Author, Year). Privacy is the right to limit access to personal information, while confidential data is personal information given with the understanding it won't be disclosed (Author, Year). Identifiable information can link responses back to the participant, and confidentiality is the researcher's obligation to restrict access to personal information (Author, Year). Anonymous data lacks personal identifiers, and safeguards are needed to prevent harms from privacy invasion/confidentiality breaches (Author, Year). Informed consent requires information about the research (procedure, purpose, risks, benefits, withdrawal option), comprehension (ensuring understanding), and voluntary consent (without coercion) (Author, Year). An Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews research to protect human subjects' rights and welfare, ensuring projects conform to regulations and assisting researchers in conducting ethical research (Author, Year). Community assessments may require IRB approval (Author, Year).

Research ethics can be linked to the pursuit of the good or virtuous life (Author, Year). Major drivers for research ethics development include the Nuremberg Trials and the Doctors Trial, which highlighted the torture and murder of victims in the name of research (Author, Year). The Nuremberg Code, containing 10 principles, served as a foundation for ethical clinical research (Author, Year). The Helsinki Declaration emphasizes independent review of research projects, preserving accuracy of results, protecting privacy and confidentiality, obtaining informed consent, and providing specific protection for vulnerable groups (Author, Year). The Belmont Report and the CIOMS Code are also relevant (Author, Year). Ethical controversies include the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, Milgramâ€™s Study of Obedience, and the Stanford Prison Experiment (Author, Year). Maintaining trust in social research requires ethical assurance systems, clear responsibilities, and independent overview (Author, Year). Researchers should be familiar with ethical principles and policies to ensure the safety of research subjects and prevent irresponsible research (Author, Year). Ignorance of policies is not an excuse for ethically questionable projects (Author, Year). The ESRC Research Ethics Framework outlines six key principles: maximizing benefit and minimizing harm, respecting rights and dignity, ensuring voluntary and informed participation, conducting research with integrity and transparency, defining clear responsibilities, and maintaining research independence (Author, Year). Ethical issues should be considered throughout the research lifecycle (Author, Year). The Academy of Social Sciences has five guiding ethics principles: inclusivity, respect for individuals and groups, integrity, social responsibility, and maximizing benefit while minimizing harm (Author, Year). Ethical considerations are also relevant in social media and online research (Author, Year). Ethical approval is required for research involving human participants or data (Author, Year).

Ethical practices are important throughout a research project, and ethical issues should be anticipated prior to the study (Author, Year). Proposals should address ethical considerations (Author, Year). Maxwell's list of core arguments for a proposal includes addressing ethical issues (Author, Year). Qualitative (constructivist/interpretivist and participatory-social justice), quantitative, and mixed methods proposal formats all include a section on anticipated ethical issues (Author, Year).
