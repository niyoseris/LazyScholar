# Personality Traits and Music Taste

### Personality Traits and Music Taste

Individual differences in music preferences are closely linked to personality (Author, Year). Research has identified several music-preference dimensions, including Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic, which correlate with various personality dimensions, such as Openness (Author, Year). The examination of these ties can provide insight into the motivations behind music listening (Author, Year). Indeed, personality influences an individual's behavior, interests, and tastes, with similar personality traits often leading to similar patterns in these areas (Author, Year). The Five-Factor Model (FFM), comprising Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, provides a framework for understanding these relationships (Author, Year). For example, energetic and rhythmic music is associated with extraversion and agreeableness (Author, Year).

Several studies have explored the specific connections between personality traits and music preferences (Author, Year). Cattell theorized that music preferences could reveal unconscious aspects of personality (Author, Year). Sensation seeking, for instance, is related to preferences for rock, heavy metal, and punk music, while extraversion and psychoticism predict preferences for music with exaggerated bass, such as rap and dance music (Author, Year). Furthermore, personality traits influence music taxonomy choices, with openness to experience increasing the likelihood of browsing music by mood, conscientiousness increasing the choice of browsing by activity, and high neuroticism being associated with browsing by activity or genre (Author, Year). Extraversion is also related to preferences for country, pop, religious, and soundtrack music (Author, Year). Openness to experience is the strongest predictor of experiencing chills from music, with individuals high in openness preferring reflective and complex genres like classical, jazz, and folk (Author, Year). Engagement with music mediates the effect of openness on chills (Author, Year).

Gender also plays a role in musical taste, with men tending to prefer heavier music and women preferring chart pop, reflecting gender-role attributes (Author, Year). Men's music choices are linked to aggression and dominance, while women's choices relate to emotions and relationships (Author, Year). Gender identity influences music taste, and expressiveness and instrumentality may also influence musical taste (Author, Year). Overall, personality plays a significant role in shaping music preferences and the overall experience of listening to music (Author, Year).
