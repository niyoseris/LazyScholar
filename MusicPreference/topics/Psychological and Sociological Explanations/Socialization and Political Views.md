# Socialization and Political Views

### Socialization and Political Views

Political socialization is a crucial factor in the formation of public opinion, with sources including family, schools, media, and political events (Author, Year). These sources, along with factors such as education, income, religion, race/ethnicity, gender, and geography, influence individual opinions and party identification (Author, Year). For example, a child attending a political rally with their parent illustrates the acquisition of political values through socialization (Author, Year).

Social class also plays a significant role in shaping political preferences. Class position influences perceptions, values, and attitudes, thereby impacting political choices (Author, Year). Early research, drawing from Marxist theory, emphasized the role of class identity and consciousness, where interaction within class-based networks fostered a sense of identity and potential hostility towards other classes (Author, Year). Voting behavior was often viewed as an expression of class identification and partisanship, shaped by socializing institutions such as family, trade unions, and local communities (Author, Year). While individuals identifying as working class were historically more likely to support left-leaning political parties, more recent research suggests that class identification does not always align with material circumstances, with many individuals identifying as middle class due to reference group processes (Author, Year).

Generational differences further contribute to the evolving political landscape. Millennials and Gen Z are entering the political arena with distinct attitudes and behaviors, often exhibiting more progressive views compared to older generations (Author, Year). While these progressive views have contributed to Democratic electoral successes, young people also tend to have the lowest voter turnout rates, often expressing disillusionment with the political system (Author, Year). Studies indicate that generational values are associated with voter turnout and candidate preference; individuals with egalitarian values were more likely to support Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, while those with individualistic or hierarchical values were more likely to support Trump (Author, Year). Notably, value polarization in candidate preference is more pronounced among older generations (Author, Year). Age effects, institutional barriers, and political socialization all influence the political behavior of young people (Author, Year).

Finally, political polarization can lead to negative consequences such as political gridlock, tribalism, and the erosion of social capital (Author, Year). Media exposure is linked to polarization, with distinct patterns observed between liberals and conservatives (Author, Year). Polarized conservatives tend to rely on radio talk shows and television for news, while polarized liberals utilize newspapers, television, and social media (Author, Year). This lack of shared information sources can result in competing worldviews and limited common ground (Author, Year). While some argue that social media and online media sources contribute to polarization through "echo-chambers" or "filter bubbles," the "crosscutting interactions perspective" suggests that social media can also expose individuals to diverse opinions, potentially increasing political tolerance (Author, Year).
