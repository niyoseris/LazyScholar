# Music and Emotional Regulation

### Psychological and Sociological Explanations: Music and Emotional Regulation

Music plays a significant role in emotional regulation across various stages of life and contexts. For young children, music supports both emotional regulation and co-regulation, establishing a foundation for self-regulation of emotions, bodies, behaviors, and movements (Author, Year). The integration of music provides opportunities for positive emotional experiences and the development of skills that foster feelings of success (Author, Year). Caregivers instinctively utilize music for co-regulation, soothing children through rhythmic movements and singing, with lullabies conveying a sense of safety (Author, Year). Furthermore, music can aid in identifying and differentiating emotions, which is crucial for effective regulation (Author, Year). Rhythm, singing, and movement activities can be incorporated to build skills in regulating emotions, bodies, and behaviors, enhancing feelings of safety and calm (Author, Year). Singing about feelings can help children identify and label emotions, and music can facilitate transitions between activities (Author, Year).

Beyond childhood, individuals utilize music as a resource for emotional "work," adjusting energy levels and providing a framework for self-constitution (Author, Year). Music serves as a medium for social agency, with individuals employing musical reflexive practices to shape their identities (Author, Year). Music consumption provides a means for self-interpretation, articulating self-image, and adapting emotional states in social life (Author, Year). Individual musical use is part of the cultural constitution of subjectivity (Author, Year).

The impact of music on emotional states is also genre-dependent, with different genres eliciting varying emotional responses (Author, Year). Preferred genres tend to evoke more positive emotional responses (Author, Year). For example, blues, jazz, rap, hip-hop, soul, funk, electronica, and dance genres are associated with positive emotions, while blues, jazz, classical, folk, alternative, soundtrack, soul, funk, and death metal are associated with negative emotions (Author, Year). Pop music may be chosen to increase positive and decrease negative emotions, as listening to pop resulted in higher positive emotional responses compared to rap, while listening to rap resulted in higher negative emotional responses compared to pop or country, and listening to rock resulted in higher negative emotional responses compared to pop (Author, Year).

Finally, research indicates that interventions utilizing music in conjunction with emotional regulation techniques can be effective in managing specific emotional challenges. For instance, heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback training, combined with emotional self-regulation techniques like Freeze-Frame® and Quick Coherence®, has demonstrated a significant effect in decreasing mental, emotional, and physiological symptoms of music performance anxiety (MPA) in university students (Author, Year).
