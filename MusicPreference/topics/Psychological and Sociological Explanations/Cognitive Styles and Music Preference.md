# Cognitive Styles and Music Preference

### Cognitive Styles and Music Preference

Individual differences in music preferences are related to both personality dimensions and cognitive abilities (Cattell, as cited in [Source Material Year]; [Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Examining the connection between personality traits and music preferences may illuminate the motivations behind music listening ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Indeed, research has identified four primary music-preference dimensions: Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Furthermore, individuals high in Openness to New Experiences may gravitate towards music that reinforces their self-perception ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]).

Cognitive styles, particularly empathizing and systemizing, also appear to influence music genre preference (Greenberg et al., 2015). The need for cognitive closure (NFC), which reflects an individual's desire for definite answers and aversion to ambiguity, plays a significant role in aesthetic preferences. Individuals with a high NFC tend to report lower preference and understanding ratings for abstract art and lower preference ratings for dissonant music compared to those with a low NFC ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). This suggests that individuals with higher degrees of open-mindedness (low need for closure) prefer abstract art and dissonant music to a greater extent than those who are more close-minded (high need for closure) ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Abstract art, characterized by its ambiguous and subjective portrayal of objects or ideas, and dissonant music, featuring atonality or twelve-tone compositions, may challenge the cognitive processes of individuals who prefer an orderly and predictable environment ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Degree of understanding is a significant factor in the evaluations of art and music ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Cognitive structure, therefore, determines an individual's predisposed coping potential, thereby influencing their appreciation of aesthetic objects ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]).

Beyond cognitive styles, other factors such as sensation seeking, extraversion, and psychoticism have been linked to specific music preferences ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). For example, sensation seeking is associated with preferences for rock, heavy metal, and punk music, while extraversion and psychoticism predict preferences for music with exaggerated bass ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). Music can influence mood, energy levels, and emotional states ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). "Sedative" music (slower tempi, softer) and "Stimulative" music (fast paced, louder) may broadly apply to classical and rock music, respectively ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]). The subjective nature of music, influenced by cultural, developmental, biochemical, and musical exposure, makes controlling its effects on cognitive responses during exercise difficult ([Source Material Author], [Source Material Year]).
