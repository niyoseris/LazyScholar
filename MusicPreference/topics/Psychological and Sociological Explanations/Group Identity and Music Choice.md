# Group Identity and Music Choice

### Group Identity and Music Choice

Music plays a significant role in identity development, both individually and collectively. Group identity, often rooted in shared experiences and values, can be significantly influenced by musical preferences and participation (Author, Year). Music therapy groups, for example, can alleviate uncertainty and deepen the identity exploration process by informing and empowering one's sense of self, exploring individual dimensions, and expressing needs (Author, Year). Interventions such as music presentations, music and imagery experiences, art making, and the creation of identity playlists can facilitate this process (Author, Year). Furthermore, participation in these groups can be perceived as a positive experience, contributing to personal development and self-care (Author, Year).

The concept of aesthetic identity further elucidates the connection between music and group affiliation. Aesthetic identity involves the cultural alignment of artistic genres to social groups, leading groups to perceive certain genres as representing "our" or "their" art and music (Author, Year). This process solidifies social boundaries as groups claim genres as their own, tying group identities to the aesthetic standards associated with those genres (Author, Year). The construction of genres often involves erecting boundaries between groups, such as distinguishing between "black music" and "white music," and adherence to particular aesthetic standards becomes a marker of group identification (Author, Year).

Participation in musical ensembles, such as choirs, also fosters group identity and reinforces social unity. Singing can bond a group, solidify social ties, and reinforce cultural and social boundaries (Author, Year). For many singers, participation in a particular choir is integral to their social identity, as they value spending time with individuals who share common interests (Author, Year). Choirs provide "satisfaction from social approval and acceptance... [members] can feel socially safe," highlighting the importance of the social dimension of singing (Author, Year). Musical ensembles function as subcultures, offering avenues for personal growth and social support, creating a safe and welcoming community (Author, Year). An individual's perceived value within the group can directly impact their self-worth and self-identity (Author, Year).

Finally, identity fusion, a visceral sense of "oneness" with a group, motivates pro-group behaviors (Author, Year). Unlike social identity theory, where the group eclipses the personal self, fusion theory emphasizes the role of the personal self and intragroup relationships (Author, Year). Strongly fused individuals retain their personal agency and cultivate close ties with fellow group members, leading to the endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors (Author, Year). This demonstrates how deeply ingrained musical preferences and participation can become in shaping and reinforcing group identity.
