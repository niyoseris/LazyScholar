3. **web_scraper/utils/__init__.py**: Updated to import file utility functions

## Implementation Details

### LazyScholar Class

The main `LazyScholar` class implements the following functionality:

- **Problem Statement Analysis**: Uses Gemini Flash 2.0 to analyze the problem statement and generate topics and subtopics
- **Web Search**: Searches academic databases for relevant papers
- **PDF Processing**: Downloads and extracts information from PDF files
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts relevant information for each subtopic
- **Paper Generation**: Compiles all research into a final academic paper

### Integration with Existing Code

The implementation leverages the existing web_scraper package for:

- Browser automation (browser_factory)
- Vision analysis (vision_helper)
- File operations (file_utils)

### Workflow

The LazyScholar application follows this workflow:

1. User provides a research problem statement
2. Application analyzes the problem statement to generate topics and subtopics
3. For each topic, the application searches academic databases
4. For each search result, the application downloads and processes PDF files
5. For each PDF, the application extracts content relevant to each subtopic
6. The application writes subtopic files with extracted content
7. The application compiles all research into a final paper

## Key Features Implemented

- **Topic Generation**: Automatically generates topics and subtopics from a problem statement
- **Academic Search**: Searches academic databases for relevant papers
- **PDF Processing**: Downloads and extracts information from PDF files
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts relevant information for each subtopic
- **Paper Generation**: Compiles all research into a final academic paper
- **Organized Output**: Saves research findings in a structured directory format

## Future Work

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the LazyScholar project. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Multiple Search Engines**: Support for searching multiple academic databases
2. **Citation Management**: Improved citation extraction and formatting
3. **Interactive Mode**: Interactive mode for user feedback during the research process
4. **PDF Annotation**: Visual annotation of PDFs to highlight relevant sections
5. **Research Quality Metrics**: Metrics to evaluate the quality of the research
6. **Custom Templates**: Support for custom paper templates and formats
