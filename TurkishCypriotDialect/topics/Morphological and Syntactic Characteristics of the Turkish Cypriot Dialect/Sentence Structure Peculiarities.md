## Analysis of Sentence Structure Peculiarities in the Turkish Cypriot Dialect (Based on Provided Georgian Text)

**Note:** This analysis is based on a text discussing Georgian sentence structure. While not directly about the Turkish Cypriot dialect, we can extract general principles and apply them hypothetically to the research topic. The value lies in identifying potential areas of investigation and analytical frameworks.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Sentence Structure Peculiarities (Hypothetical Application to Turkish Cypriot Dialect)

*   **Subordinate Clause Types:** The Georgian language utilizes various subordinate clauses (noun, object, attribute, adverbial, etc.). This suggests that the Turkish Cypriot dialect likely also employs a range of subordinate clause types, each fulfilling a specific syntactic function. Research should identify and categorize these clauses.
*   **Conjunctions:** The role of conjunctions (specifically "that" - *rom* in Georgian) in forming subordinate clauses is highlighted. This indicates the importance of analyzing conjunctions in the Turkish Cypriot dialect to understand how they introduce and connect subordinate clauses.
*   **Clause Position:** The position of subordinate clauses (pre-position, post-position, inserted) is variable in Georgian. This suggests that word order and clause placement are significant features of the Turkish Cypriot dialect's syntax and should be investigated for flexibility and constraints.
*   **Word Order and Meaning:** While changing the position of clauses may not always alter the core meaning, it can affect style and emotional expressiveness. In some cases, a change in word order can render the sentence meaningless. This implies that word order in the Turkish Cypriot dialect is crucial and needs careful examination.
*   **Conjunction Type and Clause Position:** Certain conjunctions may dictate the position of the subordinate clause (e.g., complex conjunctions like "so that" often require post-position). This suggests that specific conjunctions in the Turkish Cypriot dialect may similarly constrain clause order.
*   **Tense Agreement:** The text mentions parallel tense models in independent and subordinate clauses. This suggests that tense agreement between clauses is an important aspect of sentence structure in the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

### 2. Analysis and Insights (Hypothetical Application to Turkish Cypriot Dialect)

*   **Influence of Turkish:** Given the Turkish Cypriot dialect's close relationship with Turkish, it's likely that Turkish grammar heavily influences its sentence structure. However, contact with Greek and other languages spoken on the island may have introduced unique features.
*   **Dialectal Variation:** Sentence structure may vary within the Turkish Cypriot dialect itself, depending on geographic location, social group, and level of education.
*   **Colloquial vs. Formal:** The peculiarities of sentence structure are likely more pronounced in colloquial speech than in formal writing.
*   **Potential for Code-Switching/Mixing:** The dialect may exhibit code-switching or mixing with Greek or English, which could affect sentence structure.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies (Hypothetical Examples for Turkish Cypriot Dialect)

Since the provided text doesn't offer examples from the Turkish Cypriot dialect, here are hypothetical examples to illustrate potential areas of investigation:

*   **Example of Clause Position Variation:**
    *   Turkish: *Ben biliyorum ki o gelecek.* (I know that he will come.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot Dialect: *Ki o gelecek, ben biliyorum.* (That he will come, I know.) (Pre-positioning for emphasis?)

*   **Example of a Unique Conjunction:**
    *   Turkish: *Çünkü yağmur yağıyor, dışarı çıkamıyoruz.* (Because it's raining, we can't go outside.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot Dialect: *Yağmur yağıyor diye, dışarı çıkamıyoruz.* (It's raining *diye*, we can't go outside.) (*diye* used in a unique way?)

*   **Example of Tense Agreement Peculiarity:**
    *   Turkish: *O geldiğinde ben uyuyordum.* (When he came, I was sleeping.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot Dialect: *O geldiğinde ben uyudum.* (When he came, I slept.) (Shift in tense usage?)

These are just examples. Actual research would involve collecting and analyzing real-world data from speakers of the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

### 4. Conclusions (Hypothetical Application to Turkish Cypriot Dialect)

Based on the Georgian text and the hypothetical application to the Turkish Cypriot dialect, the following conclusions can be drawn:

*   Analyzing sentence structure peculiarities requires a detailed examination of subordinate clause types, conjunctions, clause position, word order, and tense agreement.
*   The Turkish Cypriot dialect likely exhibits unique sentence structure features influenced by Turkish, Greek, and other languages.
*   Further research is needed to collect and analyze real-world data to identify and document these peculiarities.
*   Understanding these peculiarities is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the Turkish Cypriot dialect's grammar and its relationship to other languages.

## Analysis of Sentence Structure Peculiarities in the Turkish Cypriot Dialect (Based on Provided Georgian Text - ASSUMING APPLICABILITY)

**Important Note:** This analysis is based on a text discussing Georgian sentence structure.  Direct applicability to the Turkish Cypriot dialect is *assumed* for the purpose of this exercise, as no Turkish Cypriot data was provided.  A real analysis would require data from the target dialect.  The following points should be considered as potential areas of investigation in the Turkish Cypriot dialect, inspired by the Georgian examples.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Sentence Structure Peculiarities (Hypothetical for Turkish Cypriot)

*   **Subordinate Clause Types:** The text identifies various types of subordinate clauses based on their function (noun, object, attribute, adverbial of place, time, manner, reason, purpose, result, condition, concession).  A similar classification could be explored in the Turkish Cypriot dialect.
*   **Conjunction Usage:** The text highlights the conjunction "that" (Georgian: *rom*) and its versatility in forming various subordinate clauses.  The equivalent conjunctions in Turkish Cypriot and their range of usage would be a key area of investigation.
*   **Subordinate Clause Position:** The text notes that subordinate clauses can appear in pre-position, post-position, or inserted within the independent clause.  The frequency and implications of each position in Turkish Cypriot would be important.
*   **Word Order Flexibility:** The text discusses the flexibility of word order and its impact on meaning and expressiveness.  The rigidity or flexibility of word order in complex sentences in Turkish Cypriot, and the semantic/pragmatic effects of different orderings, would be a central focus.
*   **Complex Conjunctions:** The text mentions that complex conjunctions (e.g., "so that," "for the reason that") often dictate the position of the subordinate clause.  The role of complex conjunctions in Turkish Cypriot sentence structure would be relevant.

### 2. Analysis and Insights (Hypothetical for Turkish Cypriot)

*   **Functional Equivalence:**  Investigating whether the functional categories of subordinate clauses (noun, object, adverbial, etc.) are realized similarly in Turkish Cypriot as they are in standard Turkish or other related languages. Are there unique functional categories or different distributions of functions?
*   **Conjunction Specificity:** Analyzing the semantic range and syntactic constraints of different conjunctions in Turkish Cypriot. Are there conjunctions that are more versatile than others, and what semantic nuances do they convey?
*   **Position and Meaning:** Examining the relationship between the position of the subordinate clause and the overall meaning and emphasis of the sentence. Does pre-posing a clause, for example, always signal a specific type of emphasis or topicalization?
*   **Word Order Constraints:** Identifying any rigid word order constraints in complex sentences in Turkish Cypriot and determining the factors that contribute to these constraints (e.g., conjunction type, clause type, information structure).
*   **Dialectal Variation:** Comparing the sentence structure of Turkish Cypriot to standard Turkish and other Turkish dialects to identify any unique features or variations.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies (Hypothetical for Turkish Cypriot)

Since no Turkish Cypriot examples are provided, the following are hypothetical examples illustrating the types of analyses that could be conducted:

*   **Example 1 (Subordinate Clause Position):**
    *   Standard Turkish: *Onu gördüğümü biliyorum.* (I know that I saw him.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot: *Gördüğümü biliyorum onu.* (I know that I saw him.) - Investigating if post-posing the object clause is more common in Turkish Cypriot and its pragmatic effect.

*   **Example 2 (Conjunction Usage):**
    *   Standard Turkish: *Çalışmam lazım çünkü sınavım var.* (I need to study because I have an exam.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot: *Sınavım var diye çalışmam lazım.* (I need to study because I have an exam.) - Examining if the conjunction *diye* is used more frequently than *çünkü* in Turkish Cypriot for reason clauses.

*   **Example 3 (Word Order Flexibility):**
    *   Standard Turkish: *Eve geldiğimde yemek yiyeceğim.* (When I come home, I will eat.)
    *   Hypothetical Turkish Cypriot: *Yemek yiyeceğim eve geldiğimde.* (I will eat when I come home.) - Analyzing if the word order is more flexible in Turkish Cypriot and if it changes the emphasis of the sentence.

These examples would need to be verified with actual data from the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

### 4. Conclusions (Hypothetical for Turkish Cypriot)

Based on the (hypothetical) analysis, conclusions could be drawn about:

*   **The degree of similarity or difference between Turkish Cypriot sentence structure and standard Turkish.**
*   **The unique features of Turkish Cypriot sentence structure.**
*   **The factors that influence word order and clause position in Turkish Cypriot.**
*   **The pragmatic effects of different sentence structures in Turkish Cypriot.**

## Analysis of Text for Turkish Cypriot Dialect Research: Sentence Structure Peculiarities

This analysis focuses on extracting information relevant to the morphological and syntactic characteristics of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect, specifically concerning sentence structure peculiarities, from the provided text.  However, it's crucial to note that the provided text is about sentence structure in *Modern English*, not Turkish or the Turkish Cypriot Dialect. Therefore, the extracted information will be about general sentence structure principles, which *might* be applicable to the target research topic but requires careful consideration and adaptation.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (General Sentence Structure)

*   **Sentence as a Core Unit:** The text emphasizes the sentence as the fundamental unit of verbal communication and the highest level of syntactic organization. All other linguistic units contribute to its formation.
*   **Structural, Semantic, and Pragmatic Aspects:**  A sentence is analyzed through three key aspects: structure (form), semantics (content), and pragmatics (use).
*   **Predicativity:** Predicativity, encompassing modality and time, is identified as a crucial structural feature of a sentence. It actualizes a situation and connects it to reality.
*   **Structural Scheme:** Each sentence adheres to a specific structural scheme, a finite set of rules governing its construction within a language.
*   **Creativity in Sentence Generation:** The text highlights the creative aspect of sentence construction, where speakers generate novel sentences from a finite set of words and rules.
*   **Form and Content:** A sentence has both form (structure) and content (meaning). The form is often less consciously perceived but is crucial for distinguishing sentences from non-sentences.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Hierarchy of Linguistic Units:** The text reinforces the hierarchical nature of language, with the sentence at the apex. This suggests that understanding the sentence structure is key to understanding the language as a whole.
*   **Predicativity as a Distinguishing Feature:** The emphasis on predicativity suggests that the presence or absence of features expressing modality and time could be a significant point of comparison between the Turkish Cypriot Dialect and standard Turkish.  Are these features expressed differently, or are they absent in certain contexts?
*   **Structural Schemes and Language Specificity:** The concept of structural schemes implies that each language has its own set of rules governing sentence formation.  Identifying the specific structural schemes of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect would be a crucial step in characterizing its sentence structure.
*   **Creativity and Dialectal Variation:** The creative aspect of sentence generation suggests that dialectal variations might arise from different ways of applying or modifying the standard rules of sentence construction.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **"Night" vs. "Night.":** The example contrasting the word "night" with the sentence "Night" illustrates the concept of predicativity. The sentence presents the phenomenon as a fact of reality, incorporating modality and time.
*   **"The wind blows" vs. "The wind blow":** This example highlights the role of verb forms in expressing modality and time.
*   **"There were no fresh vegetables" vs. "Were fresh vegetables there no":** This example demonstrates how word order and formal features define whether a string of words constitutes a sentence.
*   **John, you, I, this (young) man, my roommate, Johnson's son, Ann's brother, etc.:** This example shows the variability of ways to designate even identical denotations.

### 4. Conclusions

While the provided text focuses on English sentence structure, it offers valuable general principles that can be applied to the research on the Turkish Cypriot Dialect. The key is to investigate how these principles manifest specifically within the dialect.

**Specifically for the Turkish Cypriot Dialect research, consider the following questions based on the extracted information:**

*   **Predicativity:** How is predicativity (modality and time) expressed in the Turkish Cypriot Dialect? Are there unique morphological markers or syntactic structures used?
*   **Structural Schemes:** What are the common sentence structures (subject-verb-object, etc.) in the dialect? Are there any deviations from standard Turkish?
*   **Word Order:** Are there any differences in word order compared to standard Turkish?
*   **Omission of Elements:** Are there instances where elements typically present in standard Turkish sentences are omitted in the dialect?
*   **Influence of Other Languages:** Has contact with other languages (e.g., Greek) influenced the sentence structure of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect?
*   **Complexity:** Are sentences generally simpler or more complex compared to standard Turkish?

By investigating these questions, the researcher can identify and characterize the sentence structure peculiarities of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect. Remember to use the general principles from this text as a framework for analyzing actual examples of the dialect.

# Morphological and Syntactic Characteristics of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect: Sentence Structure Peculiarities

Based on the provided text, which focuses on second language (L2) writing in English, it's impossible to directly extract information about the Turkish Cypriot dialect. However, we can analyze the text for potentially relevant insights into sentence structure peculiarities in *any* developing language, including dialects.  The paper discusses the cognitive processes involved in sentence production and how these processes might affect grammatical accuracy and syntactic complexity.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Sentence Structure (General L2 Writing Context)

*   **Positive Correlation Between Skills:** The study found a positive association between grammatical accuracy, complex syntactic structures, and elaborate content in L2 writing. This suggests that as learners improve in one area, they tend to improve in others.
*   **Online Processing Compromise:** The online production of correct grammar was compromised when complex content was expressed. This indicates a trade-off between content complexity and grammatical accuracy during real-time writing.
*   **Attention and Cognitive Resources:** The paper highlights the role of attention and cognitive resources in L2 sentence production. Producing grammatically correct and syntactically complex sentences requires cognitive effort, especially in a developing language.
*   **Working Memory:** Working memory capacity is linked to syntactic complexity. Individuals with greater working memory capacity tend to produce more syntactically complex utterances.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Skill Learning vs. Online Performance:** The paper distinguishes between skill learning (long-term acquisition) and online performance (real-time production). This distinction is crucial for understanding sentence structure peculiarities. A dialect speaker might *know* the correct structure but struggle to produce it consistently in spontaneous speech due to cognitive load.
*   **Automaticity:** Native speakers often produce grammatically correct and syntactically complex sentences automatically. However, in a developing language or dialect, these processes require more conscious attention, leading to potential errors.
*   **Attentional Overload:** When cognitive resources are limited, attentional overload can lead to decreased syntactic complexity and increased grammatical errors. This is particularly relevant to dialect speakers who might be code-switching or dealing with interference from the standard language.
*   **Working Memory Limitations:** Working memory limitations can affect the ability to process and produce complex sentence structures. This could explain why dialect speakers sometimes simplify sentences or use less complex constructions.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies directly related to the Turkish Cypriot dialect. The study focuses on ESL students and their writing in English.  However, the study by Murray, Holland, & Beeson (1998) is mentioned, which showed that aphasic individuals (who require more attention for language production) exhibited decreased syntactic complexity and increased grammatical errors when attention was divided. This illustrates the impact of attentional demands on sentence structure.

## 4. Conclusions

While the text doesn't directly address the Turkish Cypriot dialect, it provides a framework for understanding sentence structure peculiarities in any developing language variety. The key takeaway is that sentence production is a complex cognitive process influenced by factors such as skill level, attentional resources, and working memory capacity.  Therefore, when studying the Turkish Cypriot dialect, researchers should consider:

*   The level of proficiency of speakers in the dialect.
*   The cognitive demands of speaking the dialect, especially in situations where code-switching or language contact is involved.
*   The working memory capacity of speakers and how it might affect their ability to produce complex sentences.
*   The distinction between competence (knowledge of the dialect's rules) and performance (actual language use).

Further research would need to be conducted to specifically investigate these factors in the context of the Turkish Cypriot dialect.


# Analysis of Academic Paper for Turkish Cypriot Dialect Research

This analysis focuses on extracting information relevant to the topic of "Morphological and Syntactic Characteristics of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect," specifically the subtopic of "Sentence Structure Peculiarities," from the provided academic paper.

## 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

The provided text does **not** directly address the Turkish Cypriot dialect or its sentence structure. It focuses on second language (L2) sentence production in English, particularly within an ESL context. However, some general findings about sentence production and processing in L2 learners *could* be extrapolated and considered when researching the Turkish Cypriot dialect, although with caution. These include:

*   **Syntactic Complexity and Grammatical Accuracy Trade-off:** The study found that, within individuals, the online production of correct grammar was compromised when complex science content was expressed. This suggests a potential trade-off between syntactic complexity and grammatical accuracy in L2 production.
*   **Working Memory and Syntactic Complexity:** The paper mentions a correlation between working memory capacity and the production of syntactically complex utterances with more subordinate/embedded clauses.
*   **Attention and Grammatical Accuracy:** The paper suggests that grammatical accuracy in L2 production requires more attention than in a native language. Divided attention can lead to decreased syntactic complexity and increased grammatical errors.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

While the paper doesn't directly analyze the Turkish Cypriot dialect, the insights regarding L2 sentence production can be used as a framework for investigating sentence structure peculiarities in the dialect.

*   **Cognitive Load:** The findings suggest that peculiarities in sentence structure in the Turkish Cypriot dialect might be related to cognitive load. If certain syntactic structures are less automatized or require more cognitive resources, speakers might simplify them or make errors when processing complex information.
*   **Language Contact:** The Turkish Cypriot dialect has been influenced by contact with other languages, particularly English and Greek. This contact could have led to changes in sentence structure, potentially resulting in simplification or the adoption of structures from the contact languages. The cognitive load associated with these borrowed structures could also influence their usage and accuracy.
*   **Skill Learning vs. Online Performance:** The distinction between skill learning and online performance is relevant. Some sentence structures might be learned and understood, but their accurate and fluent production in real-time conversation might be challenging due to attentional demands.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

The provided text does not contain examples or case studies directly related to the Turkish Cypriot dialect. The examples provided relate to English L2 learners and aphasic individuals.

## 4. Conclusions

The provided paper, while not directly related to the Turkish Cypriot dialect, offers a framework for understanding the cognitive processes involved in L2 sentence production. This framework can be used to investigate sentence structure peculiarities in the Turkish Cypriot dialect by considering factors such as:

*   **Cognitive load associated with specific syntactic structures.**
*   **The influence of language contact on sentence structure.**
*   **The distinction between learned knowledge and online performance.**
*   **Working memory capacity of speakers.**

**Important Note:** It is crucial to remember that the paper focuses on English L2 learners. Applying these findings directly to the Turkish Cypriot dialect requires careful consideration of the specific linguistic and sociolinguistic context of the dialect. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which these findings are applicable.

*   **Structural Properties:** Existential sentences typically exhibit the following:
    *   **Expletive Subject:** Presence of an expletive subject (e.g., "there" in English, "il" in French), though some languages lack this.
    *   **Verb Homophony:** The verb is often homophonous with "to be," "to have," or a verb related to possession. Rarely with a verb that literally means "exist".
    *   **Pivot Nominal:** A "pivot" nominal describes the entity whose existence is being discussed. This pivot is subject to semantic restrictions.
    *   **Coda Phrase:** A "coda" phrase may appear, external to the pivot noun phrase. Coda phrases also have semantic restrictions.
    *   **Locative Expression:** A locative expression may be present, sometimes obligatory and "bleached" of content.
*   **Relationship to Other Sentence Types:** Existential sentences are often truth-conditionally equivalent to copular sentences.
*   **Theoretical Disagreement:** Linguists disagree on the syntactic and semantic relationships between the elements within an existential sentence.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The text highlights the complexity of existential sentences, demonstrating that they are not simply statements of existence but rather specialized constructions with specific structural and semantic properties.
*   The discussion of expletive subjects, verb homophony, pivot nominals, and coda phrases provides a framework for analyzing the structure of existential sentences in different languages.
*   The mention of the "definiteness restriction" and "predicate restriction" suggests that the choice of nominals and predicates in existential sentences is not arbitrary but governed by specific semantic and pragmatic constraints.
*   The debate among linguists regarding the syntactic and semantic relationships between the elements of existential sentences underscores the challenges in providing a unified analysis of these constructions.
*   The comparison to copular, possessive, and locative sentences suggests that existential sentences may share underlying structural or semantic features with these other sentence types.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **(1a) There is one even prime number.** - English example with expletive subject.
*   **(1b) One even prime number exists.** - English example without specialized syntax, not considered existential in this context.
*   **(1c) There stood in the corner an empty coat rack and umbrella stand.** - English example of a "presentational-there" construction, distinct from existential sentences.
*   **(2a) There are bugs eating the corn.** - English example with expletive subject and coda phrase.
*   **(2b) Il y a eu une reunion.** (French) - Example with expletive subject and locative clitic.
*   **(2c) Hi ha espai a l'armari.** (Catalan) - Example without an expletive subject, but with a locative clitic.
*   **(2d) Āe he taniwha.** (Maori) - Example without an expletive subject.
*   **(3a) Es gab ein Kind in dem Garten.** (German) - Example with "geben" ('give') used as the existential verb.
*   **(3b) yeS harbe tisot ad xacot.** (Hebrew) - Example with a special lexical item "yeS" as the existential verb.
*   **(4) There exists one even prime number.** - English example with "exists" as the verb, considered different from typical existential sentences.
*   **(5) Bugs are eating the corn.** - Copular sentence synonymous with (2a).
*   **(6) They ate the vegetables steamed.** - Example of a sentence with a depictive adjunct.

## Morphological and Syntactic Characteristics of the Turkish Cypriot Dialect: Sentence Structure Peculiarities - Analysis of Existential Sentences

Based on the provided text, here's an analysis relevant to the research topic:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Definition of Existential Sentences:** Existential sentences are specialized, non-canonical constructions expressing the existence or presence of something. They often have unique structural and interpretive characteristics.
*   **Cross-Linguistic Variation:** Existential sentences vary in structure, semantics, and pragmatics across languages, although they share common characteristics.
*   **Structural Properties:**
    *   **Expletive Subject:** May require an expletive subject (e.g., "there" in English), but not in all languages.
    *   **Verb Homophony:** The verb is often homophonous with "to be" or "to have," or a verb related to possession, sometimes "bleached" of its content.
    *   **Pivot Nominal:** A "pivot" nominal describes the entity whose existence is under discussion.
    *   **Coda Phrase:** A "coda" phrase may appear, external to the pivot noun phrase.
    *   **Locative Expression:** A locative expression may be present, sometimes obligatory.
*   **Relationship to Other Sentence Types:** Existential sentences are often truth-conditionally equivalent to copular sentences.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Relevance to Turkish Cypriot Dialect:** The text highlights the importance of examining the structural properties of existential sentences, including the presence or absence of expletive subjects, the nature of the verb used, and the roles of the pivot and coda phrases. This framework can be applied to analyze existential sentences in the Turkish Cypriot dialect.
*   **Potential Peculiarities:** The text suggests that the Turkish Cypriot dialect may exhibit unique features in its existential sentences, such as:
    *   The presence or absence of an expletive subject.
    *   The specific verb used to express existence (whether it's "to be," "to have," or another verb).
    *   The types of nominals that can function as the pivot.
    *   The types of phrases that can function as the coda.
    *   The presence and nature of locative expressions.
*   **Theoretical Implications:** The text discusses different theoretical approaches to analyzing existential sentences, including those that relate them to copular sentences and those that treat them as distinct constructions. These theoretical perspectives can inform the analysis of existential sentences in the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

The text provides examples of existential sentences in English, French, Catalan, Maori, German, and Hebrew. These examples illustrate the cross-linguistic variation in the structure of existential sentences.

*   **(1a) There is one even prime number.** (English - expletive subject)
*   **(2b) Il y a eu une reunion.** (French - expletive subject, locative clitic)
*   **(2c) Hi ha espai a l'armari.** (Catalan - locative clitic, no expletive subject)
*   **(2d) Āe he taniwha.** (Maori - no expletive subject, minimal structure)
*   **(3a) Es gab ein Kind in dem Garten.** (German - verb related to possession)
*   **(3b) yeS harbe tisot ad xacot.** (Hebrew - special lexical item for existence)
