## Analysis of "PROSODY IN CONTACT: POLAR QUESTIONS IN CYPRIOT VARIETIES OF GREEK AND TURKISH" for Research on Turkish Cypriot Dialect - Language Contact: Greek Cypriot Influence

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **CYT exhibits Greek-like variants in polar question (PQ) intonation:** The study identifies that some CYT speakers produce PQs with intonational patterns similar to CYG, suggesting influence from Greek.
*   **CYT also retains Turkish-like variants:**  Alongside the Greek-influenced patterns, CYT also displays intonational patterns more closely aligned with Istanbul Turkish (IST).
*   **Sociolinguistic factors likely influence variant distribution:** The distribution of Greek-like and Turkish-like variants in CYT is likely conditioned by sociolinguistic factors. The study found that speakers with recent study experience in Turkey tended to use Turkish-like intonation.
*   **Reduced use of the question particle in CYT:** CYT is reported to have a reduced use of the question particle {mI} compared to IST.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Prosodic convergence:** The paper provides evidence for prosodic convergence between CYG and CYT, specifically in the intonation of polar questions. This highlights that language contact can extend beyond lexical borrowing to influence more subtle aspects of language like prosody.
*   **Quantitative approach:** The study employs a quantitative approach to analyze intonational contours, providing more robust evidence of language contact than previous impressionistic accounts.
*   **Sociolinguistic conditioning:** The finding that sociolinguistic factors influence the distribution of intonational variants in CYT suggests that language contact is not a uniform process and that individual speakers may adopt different patterns depending on their social networks and experiences.
*   **Complexity of contact:** The presence of both Greek-like and Turkish-like variants in CYT demonstrates the complex nature of language contact, where speakers may maintain aspects of their original language while also adopting features from the contact language.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **CYT-G and CYT-T:** The study identifies two distinct patterns in CYT PQs: CYT-G (Greek-like) and CYT-T (Turkish-like). This categorization provides a concrete example of the variation within CYT and the influence of CYG.
*   **Speakers with study experience in Turkey:** The observation that CYT speakers who had recently studied in Turkey tended to use Turkish-like intonation provides a specific example of how sociolinguistic factors can influence language use.

### 4. Conclusions

*   **CYT has been influenced by CYG in terms of intonation patterns in polar questions.** The study confirms that CYT exhibits intonational patterns similar to CYG, suggesting prosodic convergence due to language contact.
*   **The influence is not uniform, and Turkish-like patterns persist.** CYT retains Turkish-like intonational patterns alongside the Greek-influenced patterns, indicating a complex interplay of language contact and language maintenance.
*   **Sociolinguistic factors play a role in the distribution of variants.** The distribution of Greek-like and Turkish-like variants in CYT is likely influenced by sociolinguistic factors, such as exposure to standard Turkish.

## Analysis of "Greek-Anatolian Language Contact and the Settlement of Pamphylia" for Research on Turkish Cypriot Dialect: Language Contact: Greek Cypriot Influence

This analysis focuses on extracting information relevant to the historical development of the Turkish Cypriot dialect, specifically concerning language contact and Greek Cypriot influence.  The provided text discusses Greek-Anatolian language contact in Pamphylia, which offers a valuable comparative case study for understanding similar phenomena in Cyprus.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Language Contact as a Driver of Dialectal Change:** The paper argues that extensive contact between Greek and Anatolian languages significantly shaped the Pamphylian dialect. This provides a framework for considering Greek Cypriot influence on the Turkish Cypriot dialect.
*   **L2 Influence:** The paper posits that Anatolian speakers learning Greek as a second language (L2) and imposing their native language's phonology and syntax on Greek was a primary driver of change in the Pamphylian dialect. This concept of L2 interference is crucial for understanding potential Greek Cypriot influence on Turkish Cypriot.
*   **Sociolinguistic Factors:** The paper highlights the importance of sociolinguistic factors, such as the relative size of the Greek-speaking population, connectedness with the broader Greek-speaking world, and attitudes towards linguistic heterogeneity, in determining the extent of language contact influence. These factors are highly relevant to the Cypriot context.
*   **Differential Impact on Linguistic Levels:** The paper notes that Anatolian influence in Pamphylian was more pronounced in phonology and syntax than in morphology and lexicon. This suggests that Greek Cypriot influence on Turkish Cypriot might also exhibit a similar pattern.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Comparative Framework:** The Pamphylian case provides a valuable comparative framework for analyzing the Turkish Cypriot dialect. By examining how language contact shaped Pamphylian, researchers can develop hypotheses about the potential impact of Greek Cypriot on Turkish Cypriot.
*   **Mechanisms of Language Change:** The paper emphasizes the role of L2 interference as a mechanism of language change. This insight can guide research on the specific ways in which Greek Cypriot speakers might have influenced the Turkish Cypriot dialect.
*   **Importance of Sociolinguistic Context:** The paper underscores the importance of considering the sociolinguistic context in which language contact occurs. Factors such as the relative status of the languages, the degree of bilingualism, and attitudes towards language mixing can all influence the outcome of language contact.
*   **Methodological Considerations:** The paper outlines a methodology for investigating language contact, including identifying a source language, establishing contact, examining the whole of the receiving language, identifying shared structural features, and determining the chronology of changes. This methodology can be adapted for research on the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Pamphylian Inscription:** The paper provides an example of a Pamphylian inscription with unusual orthography, phonology, and vocabulary, illustrating the extent of Anatolian influence. While not directly related to Cyprus, it serves as an example of the kind of linguistic evidence that can be used to demonstrate language contact.
*   **Boeotian Dialect:** The paper mentions Boeotian as a mixed dialect with Aeolic and West Greek influence, providing another example of dialect contact within the Greek-speaking world.

### 4. Conclusions

The paper's conclusion, while focused on Pamphylian, offers valuable insights for research on the Turkish Cypriot dialect. The key takeaway is that language contact can be a significant driver of dialectal change, particularly when there is a substantial population of L2 speakers who influence the target language. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering sociolinguistic factors and examining the impact of contact on different levels of the linguistic system. The Pamphylian case serves as a comparative example that can inform research on the potential influence of Greek Cypriot on the Turkish Cypriot dialect.

## Analysis of "Greek-Anatolian Language Contact and the Settlement of Pamphylia" for Turkish Cypriot Dialect Research

This analysis focuses on the provided text's relevance to the historical development of the Turkish Cypriot dialect, specifically regarding Greek Cypriot influence.  Given the text discusses Greek-Anatolian contact, parallels can be drawn to Greek-Turkish contact in Cyprus.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Language Contact: Greek Cypriot Influence

*   **Language Contact as a Driver of Change:** The paper highlights language contact as a significant factor in shaping the Pamphylian dialect of Ancient Greek.  This is directly relevant to the Turkish Cypriot dialect, which has been in prolonged contact with Greek Cypriot.
*   **L2 Influence:** The paper emphasizes the role of L2 (second language) speakers in influencing the target language. Anatolian speakers learning Greek as a second language and imposing their native language's phonology and syntax on Greek. This is a key concept applicable to the Turkish Cypriot context, where Turkish speakers learned and used Greek Cypriot.
*   **Structural Borrowing:** The paper suggests that language contact can lead to structural borrowing, particularly in phonology and syntax.
*   **Size and Isolation:** The paper argues that the extent of language influence depends on the relative size of the Greek-speaking population, the degree of connectedness with the rest of the Greek-speaking world, and attitudes towards ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Parallel Case Study:** The Pamphylian case provides a valuable parallel for understanding the development of the Turkish Cypriot dialect.  Both involve a language (Greek in Pamphylia, Turkish in Cyprus) being influenced by a geographically proximate language.
*   **Sociolinguistic Factors:** The paper underscores the importance of sociolinguistic factors in determining the extent of language influence.  This is crucial for understanding the specific historical and social context of Cyprus, including the relative sizes of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, their interactions, and their attitudes towards each other's languages.
*   **Asymmetrical Influence:** The paper notes that Greek influenced Anatolian languages through loanwords, but not structural influence. This contrasts with the Anatolian influence on Greek, which was structural. This asymmetry is important to consider when examining Greek Cypriot influence on Turkish Cypriot.

*   **Bilectalism:** The research explicitly acknowledges the bilectal nature of Cypriot Greek, existing alongside Standard Modern Greek. This is crucial because it highlights the inherent language contact situation *within* the Greek Cypriot community itself. This internal contact can serve as a parallel to the contact between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot dialects.
*   **Lexical Influence:** The CDI adaptation identifies words unique to Cypriot Greek (110 words) and words common to both Cypriot Greek and Standard Modern Greek (717 words). This demonstrates a quantifiable lexical difference between the two varieties of Greek. This methodology could be adapted to identify lexical borrowings or influences from Greek Cypriot on the Turkish Cypriot dialect.
*   **Methodology for Studying Language Contact:** The use of the CDI adaptation provides a concrete methodology for studying language development in a contact situation. By comparing vocabulary acquisition and usage, researchers can identify areas where one language variety influences another.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Parallel Contact Situations:** The bilectalism within Cypriot Greek offers a valuable parallel to the contact between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot. Understanding how Standard Modern Greek influences Cypriot Greek can provide insights into how Greek Cypriot might influence Turkish Cypriot.
*   **Lexical Borrowing as Evidence:** The identification of unique Cypriot Greek words and shared vocabulary highlights the importance of lexical analysis in studying language contact. Identifying loanwords or semantic shifts in Turkish Cypriot that originate from Greek Cypriot can provide direct evidence of language influence.
*   **Developmental Perspective:** The CDI focuses on language development in children. This suggests that language contact influences can be observed even at early stages of language acquisition. This is important because it suggests that the influence is not just a superficial phenomenon but is integrated into the language system from a young age.

PROSODY IN CONTACT: POLAR QUESTIONS IN CYPRIOT VARIETIES OF GREEK AND TURKISH  Elinor Paynea, Spyros Armostisb, Eftychia Lombardob, Rainer Simonc, Mary Baltazania  aUniversity of Oxford, bUniversity of Cyprus, cAustrian Institute of Technology elinor.payne@phon.ox.ac.uk, armosti.spyros@ucy.ac.cy, lombardo.e@unic.ac.cy, Rainer.Simon@ait.ac.at, mary.baltazani@phon.ox.ac.ukABSTRACT  Cypriot varieties of Greek (CYG) and Turkish (CYT) have been in close contact for many centuries, leading to mutual influence (e.g. lexical borrowings), despite belonging to different language families, and being typologically distinct. Little empirical research has been conducted on prosodic influence between contact languages. Some analyses of CYT polar questions report similarities with CYG, but do not give quantitative results. Using quantitative modelling of intonational contours, we compare CYG polar questions with those in CYT (geographically close), and with those in Athenian Greek (ATG) (phylogenetically close). We confirm previous research showing CYG questions are phonologically very similar to ATG, albeit with phonetic differences. We also find these patterns in CYG speakers’ L2 English. We then compare CYT questions with those in Istanbul Turkish (IST) and find, in contrast, both Greek-like variants (presumably due to contact with CYG), and more Turkish-like variants, with distribution likely conditioned by sociolinguistic factors.  Keywords: Cypriot Greek, Cypriot Turkish, intonation, polar questions, convergence 1. INTRODUCTION Within the area of contact linguistics, research on prosodic contact has received relatively less attention than other aspects of language, especially where intonation is concerned. This is partly due to certain challenges particular to prosody, rendering it arguably more elusive to analysis, e.g. lack of orthographic representation, which in turn means lack of historical textual evidence, and until recently a lack of quantitative methods for capturing more gradient properties of intonational contours. However, recent methodological advances mean that we can derive more robust forms of evidence that ongoing language contact results in intonational variation and change in varieties spoken in multilingual societies. Contact may result in either phonological or phonetic prosodic transfer [1], influencing the category of phonological tonal events (pitch accents and edge tones) or their phonetic realization.

2. 866 (n.d.). PROSODY IN CONTACT: POLAR QUESTIONS IN CYPRIOT VARIETIES OF GREEK AND TURKISH  Elinor Paynea, Spyros Armostisb, Eftychia Lombardob, Rainer Simonc, Mary Baltazania  aUniversity of Oxford, bUniversity of Cyprus, cAustrian Institute of Technology elinor.payne@phon.ox.ac.uk, armosti.spyros@ucy.ac.cy, lombardo.e@unic.ac.cy, Rainer.Simon@ait.ac.at, mary.baltazani@phon.ox.ac.ukABSTRACT  Cypriot varieties of Greek (CYG) and Turkish (CYT) have been in close contact for many centuries, leading to mutual influence (e.g. lexical borrowings), despite belonging to different language families, and being typologically distinct. Little empirical research has been conducted on prosodic influence between contact languages. Some analyses of CYT polar questions report similarities with CYG, but do not give quantitative results. Using quantitative modelling of intonational contours, we compare CYG polar questions with those in CYT (geographically close), and with those in Athenian Greek (ATG) (phylogenetically close). We confirm previous research showing CYG questions are phonologically very similar to ATG, albeit with phonetic differences. We also find these patterns in CYG speakers’ L2 English. We then compare CYT questions with those in Istanbul Turkish (IST) and find, in contrast, both Greek-like variants (presumably due to contact with CYG), and more Turkish-like variants, with distribution likely conditioned by sociolinguistic factors.  Keywords: Cypriot Greek, Cypriot Turkish, intonation, polar questions, convergence 1. INTRODUCTION Within the area of contact linguistics, research on prosodic contact has received relatively less attention than other aspects of language, especially where intonation is concerned. This is partly due to certain challenges particular to prosody, rendering it arguably more elusive to analysis, e.g. lack of orthographic representation, which in turn means lack of historical textual evidence, and until recently a lack of quantitative methods for capturing more gradient properties of intonational contours. However, recent methodological advances mean that we can derive more robust forms of evidence that ongoing language contact results in intonational variation and change in varieties spoken in multilingual societies. Contact may result in either phonological or phonetic prosodic transfer [1], influencing the category of phonological tonal events (pitch accents and edge tones) or their phonetic realization. For example, [2] show the influence of Italian early-peak H tone alignment on Buenos Aires Spanish, and [3] shows contact effects of Quechua on Cuzco Spanish. [4] report novel patterns arising from contact between Basque and Spanish. [5] documents codeswitching in the polar questions (PQs) of German-Turkish bilinguals, and [6] report that speakers of Asia Minor Greek exhibit a blend of Greek-like and Turkish-like patterns in continuation rise utterances.  1.1.
