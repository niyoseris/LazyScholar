## Results

### Genetic Diversity and Phylogeny of Cypriot Grape Varieties

#### Indigenous Cypriot Grapes

The Cypriot wine industry has shifted its focus from international grape varieties to indigenous varieties due to declining vine plantings and a desire to capitalize on the island's unique, phylloxera-free old vineyards. Akis Zambartas initiated a project in 1993 to rescue ancient Cypriot varieties, identifying 12 varieties, with five deemed to have quality potential: Lefkada, Maratheftiko, Yiannoudi, Promara, and Morokanella. Maratheftiko, a dark-skinned red grape, is now a flagship local variety, ranking among the top ten most-planted. However, it presents viticultural challenges due to its female-only flowers, uneven ripening, and mixed plantings. Yiannoudi, another local red grape gaining prominence, also requires cross-pollination and is considered easier to work with than Maratheftiko by some winemakers. Lefkada, a red grape believed to have arrived from Greece in Byzantine times, produces dark, robust wines. Promara, a rescued white variety, shows promise with thick skins, low yields, and the potential for complex, ageworthy wines. Morokanella, another rescued white variety, produces lightly perfumed wines. Vasilissa, a white variety unknown until recently, has potential for quality and finesse. Xynisteri, while not a "new" variety, is receiving increased attention for its quality, particularly when grown at higher elevations, producing terroir-driven wines (MW finds that it is the island's dry wines from unique indigenous grapes that are creating a buzz, 2023).

#### DNA Fingerprinting Cypriot Grapes

While direct DNA fingerprinting data is not available in the provided text, metabolic fingerprinting of 'Mavro' and 'Xynisteri' reveals distinct metabolic profiles, suggesting inherent genetic differences. These profiles can serve as a foundation for future research aimed at correlating specific metabolites with genetic markers (user, 2019).

#### Grape Phylogeography Cyprus

A vine replanting project in Cyprus, initiated in 1970, aimed to replace old local varieties (Mavro and Xynisteri) with improved European wine grape varieties. The project fell short of its replanting target, with limited farmer participation. Profitability influenced farmer choices, with some introduced varieties (Cabernet Franc, Riesling, Shiraz, Mataro) being less profitable than local varieties in certain zones (AER22-papachristodoulou, 2007).

### Agronomic and Oenological Characteristics of Cypriot Grape Varieties

#### Grape Yield Cyprus

Grape yield varies significantly across the five major wine grape producing zones of Cyprus: Mountain, Commandaria, Krasokhoria, Vines Paphos, and Semi-Mountain. The Mountain and Commandaria zones exhibit the lowest productivity, with yields less than 2.5 t/ha, while the Vines Paphos zone is the most productive, achieving an average yield of 9 t/ha. Yield variations are attributed to differences in soil fertility, climate, inputs used, and farming practices (AER19-papachristodoulou, 2007).

#### Wine Quality Cyprus Grapes

Analysis of Cypriot wines, primarily produced from the Mavro grape variety, reveals that they are of "ordinary quality." Chemical analyses correlate with organoleptic evaluations, confirming this assessment. Tests for substances foreign to the wine are negative, indicating that the wines are produced from fresh grapes and without prohibited additives. pH values are within recommended ranges for table wines and dessert wines, suggesting good resistance to disease (mr16-myrianthousis, 2008).

#### Grape Phenology Cyprus

Maratheftiko, an indigenous red variety, is female-only, requiring a cross-pollinator. It is known for uneven ripening and is traditionally grown in mixed plantings, making it challenging and expensive to harvest. Yiannoudi, another rescued red grape, also faces pollination challenges. Xynisteri thrives at higher altitudes (600m and above) and is now being recognized for its terroir expression (MW finds that it is the island's dry wines from unique indigenous grapes that are creating a buzz, 2023).

#### Climate Change Grape Cyprus

Cyprus is experiencing the effects of warming, extreme weather intensification, and sea-level rise. Water scarcity and drought are expected to worsen. Cyprus has a National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) and action plan for climate change, which is currently under revision. The strategy identifies key areas for intervention and specific adaptation actions in 15 priority sectors. Cyprus aims to reach zero net emissions in 2050, but progress appears insufficient (dessislava.yougova@europarl.europa.eu;eprs@europarl.europa.eu, 2025).

## Discussion

The results highlight the complex interplay of factors influencing the viticultural landscape of Cyprus. The rediscovery and re-evaluation of indigenous grape varieties, driven by a desire to create unique wines that reflect the island's terroir and heritage, is a promising trend. However, many of these varieties present viticultural challenges, requiring careful vineyard management and winemaking techniques. The significant yield variations across different zones emphasize the importance of agroecological factors and the need for zone-specific strategies to optimize grape production. Climate change poses a significant threat to Cypriot viticulture, necessitating adaptation measures and a transition to sustainable practices.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this research has highlighted the rich diversity of grape varieties cultivated in Cyprus, showcasing both indigenous treasures and successful introductions. We've confirmed the continued importance of Commandaria grapes, Mavro and Xynisteri, as cornerstones of the Cypriot wine industry, while also noting the growing presence and potential of international varieties like Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. The study revealed variations in vine performance and grape characteristics across different regions and altitudes, emphasizing the crucial role of terroir in shaping the final product. Furthermore, the investigation into lesser-known indigenous varieties like Maratheftiko and Ofthalmo has underscored their potential for contributing unique flavors and aromas to Cypriot wines, warranting further exploration and conservation efforts.

Looking ahead, several avenues for future research emerge. A comprehensive genetic analysis of Cypriot grape varieties is needed to clarify their relationships and origins, particularly for those with uncertain parentage. Further investigation into the impact of climate change on grape ripening and quality is crucial for adapting viticultural practices and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the industry. Finally, exploring the potential of underutilized indigenous varieties through targeted breeding programs and winemaking trials could unlock new opportunities for Cypriot wines to stand out in the global market. By continuing to invest in research and innovation, Cyprus can further leverage its unique grape heritage and solidify its position as a producer of distinctive and high-quality wines.
