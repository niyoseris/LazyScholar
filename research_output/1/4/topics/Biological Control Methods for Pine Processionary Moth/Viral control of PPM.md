# Viral control of PPM

### Viral Control of *Thaumetopoea pityocampa*

*Thaumetopoea pityocampa* (PPM), commonly known as the pine processionary moth, represents a significant defoliator in forests across Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (Author, Year). Given its economic and ecological impact, research has focused on identifying effective control strategies, including biological control methods. While various pathogens, including viruses, have been reported to infect PPM, their potential as specific biocontrol agents is under investigation (Author, Year). Viral pathogens are considered to have a lower risk of affecting non-target species compared to bacterial or fungal pathogens, as demonstrated in the control of gypsy moths with *B. thuringiensis* applications (Author, Year). Recent research employing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of RNA from PPM larvae collected from 12 different locations in Turkey has aimed to (i) generate a comprehensive larval transcriptome to enhance understanding of the pest's biological aspects and (ii) identify potential viral pathogens naturally occurring in these insects, which could serve as novel tools for biological control (Author, Year). Transcriptome analysis has led to the identification of viruses such as iflavirus, cypovirus, and rhabdovirus (Author, Year). This identification of potential viral pathogens allows for the possibility of future biological control strategies (Author, Year).
