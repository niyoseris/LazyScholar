### Current Treatment Options: Minoxidil and Finasteride

While this document primarily focuses on finasteride monotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), it offers insights relevant to understanding finasteride's mechanism and effects, which are pertinent to its use in treating baldness (androgenetic alopecia).

**Finasteride: Mechanism of Action and Effects**

Finasteride is identified as a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI). The document explicitly states that 5-ARIs function by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This mechanism is crucial because DHT is implicated in both BPH and androgenetic alopecia. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can decrease prostate volume in BPH and, by extension, potentially mitigate hair follicle miniaturization in androgenetic alopecia. The document notes that finasteride specifically inhibits type 2 5-ARI.

**Efficacy and Adverse Events**

The study, a systematic review of clinical trials, included 8821 patients across 12 original articles. Follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 54 months. The review found that finasteride had a moderate effect in reducing prostate volume (standardized mean difference (SMD) effect between 0.5 and 0.8). While the document focuses on BPH-related symptoms, it acknowledges that finasteride monotherapy can lead to adverse events, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and anxiety. The review also cites research suggesting a potential correlation between 5-ARI administration and the risk of suicidal attempts and depression. These adverse effects are sometimes collectively referred to as post-finasteride syndrome.

**Methodology**

The systematic review included a search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to December 2018. The search strategy employed primary and secondary fields, including terms like "benign prostatic hyperplasia," "low tract urinary symptoms," "5 alpha-reductase inhibitor," "finasteride," "5-ARI monotherapy," and "side effects." The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with 5-ARI and placebo administration, daily 5-ARI treatment, and a diagnosis of BPH/LUTS. Studies were required to report functional outcome measures, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume (PV), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), post-void residual urine (PVR), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and adverse events (AEs).


### Current Treatment Options: 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors (5ARIs)

This section reviews the current understanding of 5ARI monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), focusing on efficacy and safety.

**Efficacy of 5ARI Monotherapy:**

A meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 23,395 patients (11,392 in the treatment group and 12,003 in the placebo group) was conducted to assess the efficacy of 5ARI monotherapy compared to placebo in symptomatic BPH patients. The study included data from PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, and Embase databases from 1966 to March 2017. The parameters analyzed included prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume (PV), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), post-void residual urine (PVR), voiding symptoms of IPSS (voiding IPSS), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and adverse events (AEs).

The meta-analysis revealed that 5ARI treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in all variables except PVR compared to placebo. However, the effect size of differences showed a declining trend in PV, IPSS, and Qmax in more recent years of publication. Ratio of means (ROM) analysis indicated no significant increase in PV in the placebo group (ROM = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88, 1.14).

**Safety and Adverse Events:**

The 5ARI treatment was associated with a significantly higher incidence of decreased libido (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.36, 2.13), ejaculatory disorder (OR = 2.94; 95% CI, 2.15, 4.03), gynecomastia (OR = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.41, 3.83), and impotence (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.32, 2.29).

**Limitations:**

The study acknowledges limitations including heterogeneity among the included studies and the absence of direct comparisons between alpha-blockers and 5ARIs. Furthermore, adverse events such as depression and suicidal attempts could not be adequately analyzed within the meta-analysis setting.

**Conclusions:**

While 5ARI monotherapy demonstrates a statistically significant clinical benefit compared to placebo, the effective size is considered small. Moreover, the risk of adverse events, particularly sexually related complications, is high. The authors suggest that additional head-to-head studies are necessary to re-evaluate the clinical efficacy of 5ARIs compared to alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers.


### Mevcut Tedavi Seçenekleri: Minoksidil ve Finasterid

Bu belgede, benign prostat hiperplazisi (BPH) tedavisi için kullanılan finasterid (PROSCAR®) hakkında hasta bilgilendirme notları yer almaktadır. Bu notlar, finasteridin saç dökülmesi (kellik) tedavisindeki rolüne doğrudan değinmese de, ilacın etki mekanizması ve yan etkileri hakkında önemli bilgiler sunmaktadır.

**Finasterid'in Etki Mekanizması:** Finasterid, dihidrotestosteron (DHT) adı verilen önemli bir hormonun seviyelerini düşürerek etki gösterir. DHT, prostat büyümesinin ana nedenlerinden biridir. DHT seviyelerini düşürmek, çoğu erkekte büyümüş prostat bezinin küçülmesine yol açar.

**Finasterid'in Yan Etkileri:** Finasterid'in yan etkileri arasında iktidarsızlık (ereksiyon olamama), cinsel istekte azalma ve ejakülasyon sorunları (semen miktarında azalma gibi) yer alabilir. Bazı erkeklerde meme büyümesi ve/veya hassasiyeti de görülebilir. Alerjik reaksiyonlar (döküntü, kaşıntı, kurdeşen, dudak ve yüz şişmesi gibi) ve nadiren testis ağrısı da bildirilmiştir.

**Önemli Uyarılar:** Finasterid, yalnızca erkekler tarafından kullanılmalıdır. Hamile veya hamile kalma potansiyeli olan kadınlar finasterid kullanmamalıdır. Hamile bir kadın, finasteridin aktif maddesini oral yoldan veya cilt yoluyla emerse, erkek bebekte cinsel organ anormalliklerine neden olabilir.

**Prostat Kanseri Taraması:** Finasterid BPH semptomlarını tedavi etmek için reçete edilir, ancak prostat kanseri için bir tedavi değildir. Erkeklerin 50 yaşından (veya ailede prostat kanseri öyküsü varsa 40 yaşından) itibaren yılda bir kez prostat kanseri taramasından geçmeleri önerilir. Finasterid, prostat-spesifik antijen (PSA) değerlerini değiştirebilir.

Androgenetik alopesi (AGA), dünya çapında popülasyonun %60-70'ini etkileyen en yaygın saç dökülmesi şeklidir. Erkeklerin %80'ine ve kadınların %50'sine kadarını yaşamları boyunca etkileyebilir. AGA, saçın çapında, uzunluğunda ve pigmentasyonunda ilerleyici bir azalmaya neden olur. Bu durum, androjenlere duyarlı foliküllerde testosteron (T) ve daha önemlisi, metaboliti 5α-dihidrotestosteron (5α-DHT) gibi potent androjenlerin etkisiyle zamanla kötüleşir. 5α-redüktaz enzimi aracılığıyla T, DHT'ye metabolize olur ve DHT'nin androjen reseptörlerine afinitesi T'den 5 kat daha fazladır. Bu nedenle, 5α-redüktazın inhibisyonu, AGA'yı tedavi etmek için en iyi bilinen hedeftir.

AGA'da, ilerleyici saç folikülü minyatürleşmesi ve terminal foliküllerin vellus benzeri foliküllere dönüşümü meydana gelir. Bu foliküllerin anagen fazı kısalır ve kısa ve ince saç telleri üretirler. Kadınlarda AGA, frontal saç çizgisinin korunmasıyla birlikte taç bölgesinde ve orta-frontal saç derisinde yaygın incelme ile karakterize kadın tipi saç dökülmesine (FPHL) neden olur (Ludwig tipi AGA). Erkeklerde ise bitemporal gerileme ve verteks kelliği ile karakterize erkek tipi saç dökülmesine neden olur.

Günümüzde, AGA tedavileri için spesifik ve etkili ilaçlar elde etmek önemli bir zorluktur. AGA'nın tıbbi tedavileri arasında topikal minoksidil, antiandrojen ajanlar ve 5-alfa redüktaz inhibitörleri bulunur. 5-alfa redüktaz inhibitörleri arasında, finasterid ve dutasterid kadınlarda kontrendike olsa da, *Serenoa repens* ve *Pygeum africanum*'dan elde edilen bitki özleri ile geniş klinik deneyim bulunmaktadır. Bu bitki özleri, iyi bilinen benign prostat hiperplazisi, nonspesifik pelvik sendrom, sistosel, premenstrüel gerginlik ve postpartum mesane atonisi tedavilerinde kullanılmaktadır. *Serenoa repens* ve *Pygeum africanum* bitki özleri, 5-alfa redüktazı inhibe edici aktiviteye sahiptir ve hem erkeklerde hem de kadınlarda AGA tedavisi için uygulanabilir ve güvenli bir seçenek haline gelmektedir.

*In vitro* çalışmalar, β-sitosterol ve saponinler gibi fitosteroller içeren *Serenoa repens* özlerinin, tip I ve tip II 5-alfa redüktazı inhibe edebildiğini ve insanlarda 5α-DHT'yi azaltabildiğini göstermiştir. *Pygeum africanum* kabuğundan elde edilen özler de triterpenler ve fitosteroller, özellikle β-sitosterol içerir ve 5-alfa redüktazı inhibe edici özellikler göstermiştir.

Finasterid'in geçmişte yaptığı gibi, *Serenoa repens* ve *Pygeum africanum*'un lipid özleri, benign prostat hiperplazisi tedavisinden AGA gibi kutanöz bozuklukların tedavisine doğru ilerlemektedir.


### Current Treatment Options: Minoxidil and Finasteride

Five-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) are standard treatments for androgenic alopecia, particularly male pattern hair loss (MPHL), due to the role of androgens in hair loss. These inhibitors function by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thereby reducing prostate volume or promoting the regeneration of hair follicles. Finasteride, a type 2 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) inhibitor, and dutasteride, which inhibits both type 1 and 2 5-AR, are the two main types of 5-ARIs currently available. While dutasteride inhibits both types, both medications have demonstrated equal efficacy.

However, the long-term safety of 5-ARIs has been a subject of controversy due to limited evidence. Adverse events, particularly sexual adverse events, have been reported for two decades. Recent studies have also indicated a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts among finasteride users experiencing persistent sexual adverse events. This has led to the recognition of post-finasteride syndrome, characterized by intolerable adverse effects that persist after discontinuing the medication. Regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada have issued warnings regarding these adverse events associated with finasteride use for BPH/LUTS and alopecia.

Despite these concerns, academic evidence regarding adverse events like depression and suicidal ideation related to 5-ARI use remains limited and has yielded conflicting conclusions. While some studies have suggested an association between 5-ARI medication and depression risk, recent large case-control studies have shown limited association between 5-ARI use and depression or the risk of suicide attempts.


### Current Treatment Options: Minoxidil and Finasteride

This section focuses on the current understanding of finasteride as a treatment option for baldness, drawing from a critical review of literature concerning its use in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While the primary focus of the reviewed studies is BPH/LUTS, the mechanism of action of finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI), is relevant to understanding its potential effects on androgen-related hair loss.

**Finasteride: Efficacy and Safety Profile**

Finasteride, a 5-ARI, functions by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a key androgen implicated in both BPH and androgenetic alopecia. The review included an analysis of clinical trials evaluating finasteride monotherapy for symptomatic BPH. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to December 2018, without language restrictions. The search strategy incorporated terms such as "benign prostatic hyperplasia," "low tract urinary symptoms," "5 alpha-reductase inhibitor," "finasteride," "5-ARI monotherapy," and "side effects." Secondary fields included "PSA reduction," "placebo controlled," and "randomized clinical trials."

**Methodology and Data Analysis**

The review included data from randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing finasteride to placebo in men with BPH/LUTS. Inclusion criteria mandated daily 5-ARI treatment and the measurement of functional outcomes, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume (PV), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), post-void residual urine (PVR), voiding symptoms of IPSS, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and adverse events (AEs). Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to evaluate the effect of finasteride on continuous variables.

**Key Findings and Conclusions**

The review of 12 original articles, encompassing a total of 8821 patients, indicated that finasteride monotherapy demonstrated significant clinical benefits in BPH. Specifically, finasteride moderately reduced prostate volume (SMD between 0.5 and 0.8) and significantly improved IPSS scores and Qmax (SMD in the 0.2 to 0.5 range). However, the review also highlighted potential adverse effects associated with finasteride therapy. Sexual health dysfunctions were significantly more prevalent in finasteride-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo. While no severe adverse events or psychiatric disorders were directly retrieved, the review acknowledged warnings regarding erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and other adverse clinical implications associated with 5-ARI use. The review concluded that while finasteride monotherapy demonstrates clinical benefits, the effective size of available reports is limited, and additional studies are needed to re-evaluate its clinical efficacy and safety, particularly in comparison to combination therapies.


### Current Treatment Options: Minoxidil and Finasteride

Currently, two of the most widely utilized and researched pharmacological interventions for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) are topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. Minoxidil, available in various concentrations, is a potassium channel opener that prolongs the anagen phase of hair growth, although the precise mechanism of action remains incompletely elucidated. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in increasing hair density and reducing hair loss progression in both men and women with AGA (insert citation). Finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, functions by reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a key androgen implicated in the pathogenesis of AGA. Studies have consistently shown that finasteride effectively reduces DHT levels in the scalp and serum, leading to a decrease in hair loss and, in many cases, hair regrowth (insert citation).

While both minoxidil and finasteride have demonstrated significant efficacy, they are also associated with potential side effects. Common side effects of minoxidil include scalp irritation and, less frequently, hypertrichosis. Finasteride's side effect profile includes sexual dysfunction (e.g., decreased libido, erectile dysfunction) in a small percentage of men, although these effects are often reversible upon discontinuation of the medication (insert citation). The long-term safety and efficacy of both treatments continue to be monitored in ongoing clinical trials and post-market surveillance studies.


### Current Treatment Options: Minoxidil and Finasteride

In the management of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), both topical minoxidil and finasteride are frequently employed. Topical minoxidil, typically at a 5% concentration, is a common treatment option for both male and female pattern hair loss. While the precise mechanism of action remains incompletely understood, minoxidil is thought to prolong the anagen phase of hair growth and increase follicle size. Finasteride, an oral medication, is another therapeutic intervention, although its use is primarily indicated for male patients. Finasteride functions as a 5α-reductase inhibitor, thereby reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a key androgen implicated in the pathogenesis of AGA. The reduction of DHT levels can slow or halt the progression of hair loss and, in some cases, promote hair regrowth. It is important to note that treatment with both topical minoxidil and finasteride typically requires a minimum of 6 to 12 months to evaluate efficacy.
