# Other Causes of Hair Loss: Alopecia Areata, Telogen Effluvium

### Other Causes of Hair Loss: Alopecia Areata

Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by nonscarring patches of complete hair loss, resulting from an immune response against hair follicles (Hordinsky, 2013). While the precise etiology remains elusive, vaccines, by activating the immune system, have been implicated in inducing adverse reactions, including the onset or exacerbation of AA, in genetically predisposed individuals (Vadalà et al., 2017). Several reports have documented the occurrence of AA following COVID-19 vaccination (Scollan et al., 2022; Tassone et al., 2022).

A case study detailed a 51-year-old male who developed AA shortly after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). The patient presented with discrete patches of hair loss on the scalp and beard, accompanied by pruritus and burning. Diagnostic evaluation, including a punch biopsy, confirmed the diagnosis of AA. Treatment with intralesional triamcinolone injection resulted in gradual hair regrowth over several months. This case, along with other reported cases, suggests a potential, albeit rare, association between COVID-19 vaccination and the development of AA. Glucocorticoids, administered intralesionally or systemically, are often effective in managing the condition (Tassone et al., 2022).


### Other Causes of Hair Loss: Alopecia Areata, Telogen Effluvium

This section reviews alopecia areata and telogen effluvium as distinct causes of hair loss, characterized by differing etiologies and clinical presentations.

**Telogen Effluvium:** Telogen effluvium is a common, non-scarring form of hair loss characterized by a premature transition of a higher proportion of hairs into the telogen (shedding) phase. In a normal scalp, approximately 90% of hairs are in the anagen (growth) phase and 10% in the telogen phase; however, in individuals with telogen effluvium, these proportions shift to approximately 80% and 20%, respectively, leading to increased hair shedding. Numerous triggers can induce telogen effluvium, including emotional or psychological stressors, systemic illnesses, hormonal changes, surgery, medication changes, dietary changes or abrupt weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. It is also the most common alopecia associated with systemic illness. Commonly implicated medications include acitretin, isotretinoin, beta-blockers, captopril, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, diabetic drugs, and oral contraceptives. The interval between the inciting event and the onset of shedding is typically weeks to a few months. Patients typically report an increase in hair shedding, which may persist for 6-12 months; a chronic form, though less common, can persist for years. Examination reveals diffuse thinning across the scalp, and a gentle pull test may yield approximately 10 hairs, with 1-2 hairs normally exhibiting white bulbs. Management involves reassurance, addressing any nutritional deficiencies, and discontinuing any culprit drugs, addressing underlying medical problems, or persistent stressors. Topical minoxidil 5% foam or solution may be considered, and in severe or persistent cases, oral minoxidil may be beneficial. Diagnostic evaluation includes a thorough drug history and investigation of stressful events, life changes, diet changes, or medical issues preceding the onset of hair loss, with consideration given to ferritin and TSH testing.

**Alopecia Areata:** Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease resulting in non-scarring hair loss that can affect any hair-bearing area. It is characterized by a sudden onset and an unpredictable course. The pathogenesis involves a T lymphocyte-mediated attack on hair follicles. Clinically, it presents as round patches of hair loss and may affect eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair. Hair regrowth is often initially white or gray. Diagnostic considerations include obtaining TSH, ANA, RF, Ferritin, TTG, and HbA1c levels. Management options include topical steroids, intralesional steroids, oral steroids, topical immunotherapy, immunosuppressants, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.

In the differential diagnosis of cutaneous lupus, alopecia is listed as a non-specific manifestation. Specifically, alopecia areata, scarring alopecias, and telogen effluvium are noted as potential mimickers of lupus-related hair loss. This suggests that when evaluating hair loss in the context of potential lupus, these alternative etiologies should be considered and ruled out.

### Other Causes of Hair Loss: Alopecia Areata

Alopecia areata (AA) is identified as a prevalent autoimmune disease with significant comorbidity implications. Research leveraging big data and precision medicine initiatives reveals that AA patients exhibit comorbid neuropsychiatric and metabolic conditions, suggesting shared biological underpinnings.

**Key Findings and Methodologies:**

*   **Comorbidity Identification:** Large-scale studies utilizing electronic health records (EHR) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have identified comorbidities associated with AA. One study examining 1.5 million patient records found enrichment of 34 International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes among AA patients, including neuropsychiatric disorders (epilepsy, depression, migraines, attention deficit, bipolar disorders) and metabolic conditions (type 2 diabetes, disorders of lipid metabolism, aromatic amino acid metabolism).
*   **PheWAS Analysis:** Phenome-wide association studies, linking EHR data to genetic data, identified associations between ICD codes and disease risk alleles previously identified in genome-wide association studies. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AA implicated over 1,000 ICD codes.
*   **Data Sources:** The research utilized diverse data sources, including EHR data, publicly available databases, and genetic data, to identify consistent evidence for comorbidities.
*   **Causal Inference:** Comorbidities are considered to provide etiologic insights, suggesting shared disease mechanisms that link clinical entities. Identifying these links can aid in subtyping patients and understanding disease pathogenesis.

**Conclusions:**

Big data analysis reveals that AA is associated with a range of comorbidities beyond other autoimmune conditions, including neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders. These findings suggest shared biological mechanisms and highlight the potential for drug repurposing and improved patient management strategies. The use of precision medicine approaches, integrating genomic and clinical data, offers a promising avenue for further elucidating the complex etiology of AA and its associated conditions.


### Other Causes of Hair Loss: Alopecia Areata, Telogen Effluvium

While the primary focus of this paper is on hormonally driven hair loss, it is pertinent to acknowledge other etiologies, including alopecia areata and telogen effluvium. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition characterized by the body's immune system attacking healthy hair follicles (Moskowitz, 2014). This results in hair loss typically manifesting as patches on the scalp, although in severe cases, it can progress to complete hair loss, a subtype known as alopecia totalis (Moskowitz, 2014). Alopecia areata affects both men, women, and children.

Telogen effluvium, while not explicitly discussed in detail within this document, is implicitly relevant as the telogen phase is described as the resting phase of the hair growth cycle, lasting approximately 100 days on the scalp (Elzouki, et al., 2012). Disruptions to this cycle, leading to premature or excessive shedding during the telogen phase, can contribute to noticeable hair loss.

*(Note: The provided document focuses on Trichotillomania (TTM) and does not contain information on Alopecia Areata or Telogen Effluvium. Therefore, this section will present the relevant information on TTM as a cause of hair loss.)*

Trichotillomania (TTM), characterized by repetitive hair pulling resulting in significant hair loss, is currently classified as an impulse-control disorder, although its placement on the obsessive-compulsive spectrum has been debated (Woods et al., 2006). Diagnosis, according to DSM-IV criteria, requires evidence of increasing tension before hair pulling or during attempts to avoid it, a sensation of relief, pleasure, or gratification during hair pulling, and significant distress or impairment in occupational, social, or other areas of functioning (Woods et al., 2006).

Epidemiological research suggests that the DSM-IV criteria may be overly restrictive, potentially excluding individuals who repetitively pull their hair to the point of hair loss and functional impairment but do not experience antecedent tension or its subsequent reduction (Woods et al., 2006). Preliminary estimates indicate that pulling in the absence of tension and relief affects approximately 3.4% of college women, compared to 0.6% meeting full DSM-IV criteria (Woods et al., 2006).

Hair pulling can occur from any body region, most commonly the scalp, lashes, and brows, typically using fingers, but also tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs (Woods et al., 2006). Post-pulling behaviors, such as manipulating, chewing, or ingesting the pulled hair, are also common (Woods et al., 2006). The average age of onset is approximately 13 years in adult samples, but around 18 months in children (Woods et al., 2006).

TTM appears more prevalent in females, although this may reflect treatment-seeking bias or societal acceptability of hair loss in men (Woods et al., 2006). The gender distribution is more equal in younger children (Woods et al., 2006).

The disorder can have negative effects on physical and psychosocial functioning (Woods et al., 2006). Physical consequences include hair loss, follicle damage, changes in hair structure, scalp irritation, enamel erosion, gingivitis, and repetitive strain injury (Woods et al., 2006). Hair ingestion can lead to trichobezoars, potentially causing anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, and death (Woods et al., 2006). Psychosocial impacts include avoidance of social situations, low self-esteem, depression, irritability, and feelings of unattractiveness (Woods et al., 2006).

TTM frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders (Woods et al., 2006). Comorbidity rates indicate that a significant percentage of individuals with TTM also have mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders (Woods et al., 2006).

While a specific TTM gene has not been identified, a genetic basis has been suggested (Woods et al., 2006). Dysregulation of serotonin and dopamine systems has also been implicated (Woods et al., 2006). Neuroimaging studies have shown reduced left putamen and left ventriculate volumes in patients with TTM compared to healthy controls, as well as increased cerebellar and parietal functioning (Woods et al., 2006).

Environmental factors, such as specific hair features, cognitions, emotional experiences, or particular settings, may trigger pulling episodes (Woods et al., 2006). Specific cognitions about hair appearance and negative beliefs about appearance have also been correlated with pulling severity (Woods et al., 2006).
