### On-Balance Volume (OBV) in Cryptocurrency Trading

Technical investment cycles are driven by price changes and volume, with On-Balance Volume (OBV) serving as a technical indicator within this model (Author, Year). A related technique, the Block Volume Classification (BVC), aggregates trades based on time or volume and calculates the percentage of buy-sell orders using the price change between the close of a bar and the close of the previous bar (Author, Year). BVC aims to identify both aggressive and passive informed trading, potentially outperforming traditional order imbalances (Author, Year). Order imbalances measure the difference between aggressive buying volume and aggressive selling volume within a specific interval (Author, Year). The BVC algorithm uses a bar-based buy-sell probability rather than transaction-by-transaction classification (Author, Year). It aggregates transactions into bars based on volume or time, and uses a standardized price change from the beginning to the end of the interval to estimate the percentage of buy and sell order flow (Author, Year). While BVC-derived order imbalance is positively correlated with the high-low spread, some research casts doubt on its ability to effectively measure informed trading, suggesting it may not outperform, and may even significantly underperform, traditional order imbalances in certain tests (Author, Year).
