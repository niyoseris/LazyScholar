## Environmental Impacts of Climate Change in Cyprus: Sea Level Rise - Analysis of UN Document

This document analyzes a statement by the Republic of Cyprus to the UN General Assembly regarding the International Law Commission's report on sea-level rise in relation to international law. It focuses on extracting information relevant to the environmental impacts of climate change, specifically sea-level rise, in Cyprus.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Sea Level Rise in Cyprus

*   **Direct Experience:** Cyprus, as an island state, has directly experienced the gravity of climate change and climate-induced sea-level rise.
*   **Grave Threat:** Rising sea levels pose a grave threat to the lives and livelihoods of populations and human infrastructure globally, particularly in low-lying coastal countries and small island developing states like Cyprus.
*   **Permanent Baselines:** Cyprus advocates for the use of permanent baselines, as defined in Article 16 of UNCLOS, to address the legal effects of coastal erosion and safeguard coastal states' legal entitlements.
*   **Maritime Boundaries:** Cyprus emphasizes that the effects of rising sea levels on baselines should have no legal effect on the status of concluded maritime treaties and that maritime boundaries designated by international judicial bodies should remain intact.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Vulnerability:** The statement highlights Cyprus's vulnerability as an island state to the impacts of sea-level rise, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the issue.
*   **Legal Framework:** The statement focuses heavily on the legal implications of sea-level rise, particularly concerning maritime boundaries and statehood. It underscores the importance of upholding UNCLOS and existing international law.
*   **Proactive Measures:** Cyprus advocates for proactive measures, such as establishing permanent baselines, to mitigate the legal and practical consequences of coastal erosion due to sea-level rise.
*   **Rebus Sic Stantibus:** Cyprus argues against the application of the principle of *rebus sic stantibus* (fundamental change of circumstances) to maritime boundaries affected by sea-level rise, citing Article 62(2)(a) of the VCLT, which excludes boundary treaties from this principle.
*   **Statehood:** The statement touches upon the doctrine of statehood, emphasizing that substantial changes in territory due to sea-level rise do not necessarily extinguish a state.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The document references the *Maritime Boundary Arbitration in the Bay of Bengal (India v. Bangladesh)* case, highlighting the tribunal's focus on the "physical reality at the time of determination" and its decision not to address the issue of future coastline instability due to climate change.
*   The document references the *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case* to support the argument that the principle of *rebus sic stantibus* should not apply to maritime boundaries.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Cyprus views sea-level rise as a significant threat requiring international attention and legal clarification.
*   The statement emphasizes the importance of adhering to existing international law, particularly UNCLOS, in addressing the legal challenges posed by sea-level rise.
*   Cyprus advocates for proactive measures, such as establishing permanent baselines, to protect its maritime entitlements and sovereignty in the face of rising sea levels.
*   The statement underscores the need for the ILC Study Group to consider established legal principles and jurisprudence in its work on sea-level rise and international law.

## Environmental Impacts of Climate Change in Cyprus: Sea Level Rise

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   Cyprus, as an island state, acknowledges the severe consequences of climate change and climate-induced sea-level rise.
*   Legal stability regarding sea-level rise, particularly concerning baselines and maritime zones, is crucial for preserving the rights of coastal states under international law.
*   Cyprus supports the idea that UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) neither forbids nor excludes the fixing or freezing of baselines to preserve the maritime zones of coastal states.
*   Coastal states may designate permanent baselines to withstand the regression of the low-water line caused by sea-level rise, in accordance with UNCLOS.
*   Baselines should be permanent and not ambulatory to ensure predictability in maritime boundaries.
*   The principle of fundamental change of circumstances (rebus sic stantibus) should not apply to maritime boundaries affected by sea-level rise.
*   The effects of rising sea levels on baselines should not legally affect concluded maritime treaties.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The statement emphasizes the importance of legal stability and certainty in maritime boundaries in the face of sea-level rise.
*   It advocates for a proactive approach by coastal states to protect their maritime rights by fixing baselines.
*   The argument against applying the principle of *rebus sic stantibus* highlights the need to maintain the integrity of existing maritime agreements despite environmental changes.
