## Environmental Impacts of Climate Change in Cyprus: Water Scarcity

### 1. Key Findings Related to Water Scarcity in Cyprus

*   Cyprus is a "water-poor" country in Europe due to its semi-arid climate and limited, unevenly distributed rainfall.
*   Climate models predict rising temperatures and increased frequency/intensity of droughts, exacerbating water scarcity.
*   Total water demand exceeds availability, especially for irrigation.
*   Groundwater resources have been over-pumped, leading to seawater intrusion and deterioration of water quality.
*   A 20% drop in precipitation due to climate change resulted in a 40% reduction in surface runoff.
*   Water scarcity led to strict water rationing in 2008, including near-total bans on agricultural water supply and household restrictions.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The paper highlights the long-standing challenge of water scarcity in Cyprus, intensified by climate change impacts.
*   It emphasizes the need for integrated and sustainable water management strategies, including long-term planning and short-term drought response measures.
*   The shift towards non-conventional water sources like desalination and water reuse is presented as a crucial adaptation strategy.
*   The analysis acknowledges the trade-offs associated with desalination, such as energy consumption and potential environmental impacts.
*   Demand management strategies, including water pricing, metering, and public awareness campaigns, are considered essential for mitigating water scarcity.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Kouris Dam and Asprokremmos Dam:** Mentioned as examples of increased storage capacity through dam construction.
*   **2008 Drought:** Described as one of the most acute and prolonged droughts, leading to severe water rationing and the transportation of water from Athens.
*   **Water Saving Law of 1991:** Example of legislative measures to promote water conservation, including penalties for misuse.
