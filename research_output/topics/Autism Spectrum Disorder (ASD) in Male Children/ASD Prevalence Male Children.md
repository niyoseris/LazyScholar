## Research on ASD Prevalence in Male Children: Analysis of Yan et al. (2024)

### 1. Key Findings Related to ASD Prevalence in Male Children

*   **Overall Prevalence:** The study estimated the overall weighted prevalence of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years in the US to be 3.42% for 2021-2022.
*   **Sex Differences:** A significant difference in ASD prevalence was observed between sexes, with a higher prevalence in boys (5.14%) compared to girls (1.64%) (P < 0.001).
*   **Upward Trend:** The study observed a decade-long upward trend in ASD prevalence, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics (P for trend < .05).
*   **Specific Years:** The weighted prevalence of ASD was 3.05% in 2021 and 3.79% in 2022.
*   **Sample Demographics:** The study included 6774 boys (50.96%) and found that 346 boys (76.04%) were reported to have a diagnosis of ASD.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Significance of Sex Disparity:** The significantly higher prevalence of ASD in male children compared to female children reinforces existing knowledge about sex-based differences in ASD diagnosis. This highlights the need for further research into the biological and environmental factors contributing to this disparity.
*   **Increasing Prevalence:** The continued increase in ASD prevalence over the past decade suggests potential changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, or actual increases in the occurrence of ASD. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying causes of this trend.
*   **Methodological Rigor:** The study utilized data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a nationally representative household survey, which strengthens the generalizability of the findings to the US population.
*   **Post-Pandemic Data:** The study's focus on 2021-2022 data provides valuable insights into ASD prevalence following the COVID-19 pandemic.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The paper does not include individual case studies. The analysis is based on aggregated data from the NHIS.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The prevalence of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years in the United States remains high and has increased over the past decade.
*   Significant sex differences exist in ASD prevalence, with male children being disproportionately affected.
*   Further investigation is necessary to evaluate potential modifiable risk factors and causes of ASD.

## Research on ASD Prevalence in Male Children: Analysis of Yan et al. (2024)

This document extracts relevant information from the paper "Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children and Adolescents in the United States from 2021 to 2022" by Yan et al. (2024), focusing on ASD prevalence in male children.

### 1. Key Findings Related to ASD Prevalence in Male Children

*   **Overall Prevalence:** The study estimated the overall weighted prevalence of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years in the US to be 3.42% for 2021-2022.
*   **Sex Differences:** A significant difference in ASD prevalence was observed between sexes. The prevalence in boys was 5.14% (95% CI 4.52–5.77%), significantly higher than the 1.64% (95% CI 1.28–2.00%) prevalence in girls (P < 0.001).
*   **Upward Trend:** The study observed a decade-long upward trend in ASD prevalence, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics (P for trend < .05).
*   **Specific Years:** The weighted prevalence of ASD diagnosis was 3.05% (95% CI 2.60–3.50%) in 2021 and 3.79% (95% CI 3.24–4.35%) in 2022.
*   **Sample Demographics:** The study included 6774 boys (50.96%) in the sample. Among the 455 children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD, 346 were boys (76.04%).

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Higher Prevalence in Males:** The study reinforces the well-established finding that ASD is significantly more prevalent in males than in females. The reported prevalence of 5.14% in boys is a key statistic for understanding the scope of ASD within this specific demographic.
*   **Increasing Trend:** The continued upward trend in ASD prevalence, even after adjusting for demographic factors, suggests that factors beyond simple demographic shifts are contributing to the increase. This highlights the need for further research into potential environmental, genetic, or diagnostic factors.
*   **Public Health Significance:** The high and increasing prevalence of ASD underscores the importance of early detection, intervention, and support services for affected children and their families.
*   **Data Source:** The use of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) provides a nationally representative estimate of ASD prevalence, enhancing the generalizability of the findings.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The paper does not include individual case studies. The analysis is based on aggregated data from the NHIS.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The study concludes that the prevalence of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years in the United States remains high and has increased over the past decade.
*   The significant difference in prevalence between males and females is a notable finding.
*   The authors emphasize the need for further investigation to evaluate potential modifiable risk factors and causes of ASD.

## Analysis of "An investigation of increased rates of autism in U.S. public schools" for Research on ASD Prevalence in Male Children

This document extracts and analyzes information from the provided research paper relevant to the topic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevalence in male children.

### 1. Key Findings Related to ASD Prevalence in Male Children

*   **Higher Male-to-Female Ratios:** The paper consistently notes higher male-to-female ratios in ASD identification, specifically mentioning a ratio of **4.5:1**. This reinforces the established understanding of ASD being more prevalent in males.
*   **Overall Increase in ASD Prevalence:** The paper highlights the "substantial increase in the identification rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States." While not exclusively focused on males, this increase inherently impacts the number of male children diagnosed.
*   **CDC ADDM Study:** The paper cites the 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) longitudinal study, reporting prevalence rates of **1 in 59 children aged 8 years** (Baio et al., 2018). This provides a specific data point for overall prevalence, which is relevant when considering the male population.
*   **Historical Context:** The paper provides historical context, noting that earlier estimates from the ADDM network were 1 in 150 (2000-2002) and 1 in 68 (2010-2012) in children aged 8 years. This demonstrates the significant increase over time, impacting both male and female children.
*   **Discrepancies in Prevalence:** The paper mentions discrepancies in prevalence across settings (e.g., community clinics vs. schools). This suggests that prevalence rates may vary depending on the population being studied.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Diagnostic Migration:** The paper suggests that "diagnostic migration" (shifts in assessment procedures and criteria) significantly contributes to the increase in autism prevalence. This implies that some individuals who might not have been diagnosed with ASD under older criteria are now being identified. This could affect the number of male children diagnosed.
*   **Focus on Eligibility:** The paper argues that focusing on school eligibility data may provide a more stable measure of prevalence, as the core factor determining eligibility (whether symptoms adversely affect educational performance) has remained relatively consistent. This is relevant because it suggests that the increase in prevalence is not solely due to changes in diagnostic criteria but also reflects a real increase in the number of children needing support in schools.
*   **Complexities in Diagnosis:** The paper acknowledges the complexities behind diagnostic and eligibility determinations, noting the lack of a specific protocol for identifying ASD and the variety of assessment tools used. This highlights the potential for variability in diagnosis and eligibility, which could impact prevalence rates.
*   **Distinction between Etiology and Prevalence:** The paper emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the cause of autism and the reasons for the increase in prevalence. This is crucial for research, as focusing solely on etiology may obscure the factors driving the increase in identification rates.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

The paper does not provide specific examples or case studies. It focuses on broader trends and data analysis.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The paper concludes that there has been a significant increase in ASD prevalence in the U.S., impacting school systems.
*   The higher male-to-female ratio in ASD identification is a consistent finding.
*   Changes in diagnostic criteria and assessment procedures (diagnostic migration) have contributed to the increase in prevalence.
*   School eligibility data may provide a more stable measure of prevalence than clinical diagnoses alone.
*   Further research is needed to understand the factors driving the increase in ASD prevalence and its impact on school psychology practices.
