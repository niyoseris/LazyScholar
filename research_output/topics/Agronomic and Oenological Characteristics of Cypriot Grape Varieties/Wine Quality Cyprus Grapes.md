## Agronomic and Oenological Characteristics of Cypriot Grape Varieties: Wine Quality of Cyprus Grapes - Analysis of Myrianthousis et al. (1984)

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Compositional Analysis:** The study provides maximum and minimum values for 43 analyses performed on four wine types: Dry White, Dry Red, Sherry type, and Commandaria. These analyses cover various constituents relevant to wine quality.
*   **Mavro Dominance:** The wines analyzed were primarily produced from the Mavro grape variety, which constitutes 80% of Cyprus's grape production.
*   **Ordinary Quality Wines:** The study focused on "ordinary quality" commercial wines, providing a baseline for comparison.
*   **Organoleptic Confirmation:** Chemical analyses were correlated with organoleptic (sensory) evaluations, confirming that the analyzed wines were indeed of "ordinary quality."
*   **Absence of Prohibited Substances:** Tests for substances foreign to the wine were negative, indicating that the wines were produced from fresh grapes and without prohibited additives.
*   **pH Levels:** pH values were within recommended ranges for table wines (dry white, dry red) and dessert wines (sherry, commandaria), suggesting good resistance to disease.
*   **Constituent Ranges:** The study established ranges for various constituents (e.g., total soluble solids, ash, acidity) for each wine type, providing a reference point for assessing wine quality.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Baseline Data:** The study provides valuable baseline data on the chemical composition of Cypriot wines, particularly those made from the Mavro grape. This data was previously unpublished.
*   **Quality Control:** The research highlights the importance of chemical analysis for quality evaluation and control in winemaking.
*   **Mavro Versatility:** The study confirms the versatility of the Mavro grape, which can be used to produce both dry and sweet wines, as well as white wines.
*   **Regional Characteristics:** The compositional data reflects the specific winemaking practices and environmental conditions of Cyprus.
*   **Comparison with International Standards:** The study references international methods of analysis (O.I.V.) and compares the results with recommended values (Amerine, 1960), placing Cypriot wines in a broader context.
*   **pH Significance:** The study emphasizes the importance of pH in wine quality, particularly its role in disease resistance.
*   **Soluble Solids and Wine Type:** The study notes the expected correlation between total soluble solids and wine type, with Commandaria having the highest values due to its sugar content.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Four Wine Types:** The study provides a comparative analysis of four specific wine types: Dry White, Dry Red, Sherry, and Commandaria. This allows for a detailed examination of the compositional differences between these wines.
*   **Mavro Grape:** The study implicitly serves as a case study of wines produced from the Mavro grape, given its dominance in the Cypriot wine industry and the focus of the research.

### 4. Conclusions

*   **Establishment of Baseline Data:** The study successfully determined the maximum and minimum values of various constituents in ordinary quality commercial Cypriot wines.
*   **Quality Assurance:** The chemical analyses confirmed the absence of prohibited substances and the adherence to accepted winemaking practices.
*   **Reference Point for Future Research:** The data provides a valuable reference point for future research on Cypriot wines, particularly in relation to the impact of different grape varieties, winemaking techniques, and environmental factors on wine quality.
*   **Mavro Characterization:** The study contributes to the characterization of wines produced from the Mavro grape, highlighting its potential for producing a range of wine styles.
