## Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in Cyprus: Water Management

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   Cyprus, like other Mediterranean countries, faces water scarcity due to its semi-arid climate and limited water resources.
*   Water demand is increasing due to population growth, tourism, and increased living standards. Demand is projected to increase from 265.9 million cubic meters annually to 313.7 by 2020.
*   Agriculture is the largest water consumer (70%), followed by domestic use (20%).
*   Groundwater resources are overexploited by about 40% of the sustainable extraction level, leading to saline water intrusion, quality deterioration, and nitrate pollution.
*   Cyprus has experienced increased frequency and intensity of droughts, with a decrease in precipitation over the last century, resulting in a 40% reduction of surface runoff.
*   The Troodos mountain range is crucial for water resources, feeding most river basins and aquifers.
*   Past policies focused on increasing water supply through dam construction ("No drop of water to the sea"), increasing dam capacity from 6 million cubic meters in 1960 to 307.5 million cubic meters.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The paper highlights the unsustainable nature of solely focusing on increasing water supply. It emphasizes the need for water conservation and integrated water management.
*   Over-reliance on groundwater has led to significant environmental problems, underscoring the importance of sustainable resource management.
*   The decrease in precipitation, potentially linked to climate change, exacerbates existing water scarcity issues.
*   The fragmented responsibility for water management among different ministries has hindered effective water governance.
*   The shift towards treating municipal waste, using treated water for agriculture and groundwater recharge, and desalination indicates a move towards more sustainable practices.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Droughts of 1990-1991 and 1996-2000:** These events led to water supply restrictions for both domestic and irrigation purposes, negatively impacting the economy and social life. This highlights the vulnerability of Cyprus to water scarcity.
*   **Troodos Mountain Range:** This area is presented as a critical ecosystem for water supply, emphasizing the importance of its conservation.
*   **Past Water Policy:** The policy of "No drop of water to the sea" and the construction of dams is presented as an example of a supply-side approach that, while initially successful, ultimately proved insufficient to address increasing water demand and environmental concerns.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Cyprus faces significant challenges in water management due to limited resources, increasing demand, and climate change impacts.
*   A shift towards integrated water management, conservation, and alternative water sources (desalination, treated wastewater) is crucial for ensuring a sustainable water supply.
*   Effective water governance and a strong legal framework are essential for addressing the complex challenges of water management in Cyprus.
*   Protecting key ecosystems, such as the Troodos mountain range, is vital for maintaining water resources.

*   Water demand is increasing due to population growth, tourism, and increased living standards. Demand is projected to increase from 265.9 million cubic meters annually to 313.7 by 2020.
*   Agriculture is the largest water consumer (70%), followed by domestic use (20%).
*   Groundwater resources are overexploited by about 40% of the sustainable extraction level, leading to saline water intrusion, quality deterioration, and depletion of aquifers.
*   Increased frequency and intensity of droughts have been observed in the last 30 years, along with a decrease in precipitation.
*   A decrease in precipitation resulted in a 40% reduction of surface runoff.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The traditional approach of increasing water supply is no longer viable.
*   The focus is shifting towards water conservation and the conservation of water-related ecosystems.
*   Overlapping jurisdictions among different ministries have hindered effective water management.
*   Climate change is a potential factor contributing to decreased precipitation, although the analysis does not definitively prove it.
*   Over-pumping of groundwater and excessive fertilizer use contribute to water quality issues.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Droughts of 1990-1991 and 1996-2000:** These droughts led to water crises, forcing the government to impose restrictions on water supply for both domestic and irrigation purposes, negatively impacting the economy and social life.
*   **Troodos Mountain Range:** This area is highlighted as ecologically significant because it feeds most river basins and aquifers on the island. It receives the highest precipitation and generates 80% of surface runoff.
*   **Past Water Policy:** The policy of "No drop of water to the sea" led to a significant increase in dam capacity, but it was ultimately insufficient to meet growing demand and address resource depletion.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Cyprus faces significant challenges in water management due to limited resources, increasing demand, and the impacts of drought and potential climate change.
*   A shift towards integrated water management, conservation, and alternative water sources (desalination, treated wastewater) is crucial.
*   The establishment of a new Directory for Integrated Water Management is proposed to address the fragmented responsibilities and promote a holistic approach.
*   Public education and awareness campaigns are important for promoting water conservation.

## Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in Cyprus: Water Management - Analysis of World Bank Report (1995)

This document analyzes the provided text from a 1995 World Bank report on water planning and management in Cyprus, focusing on its relevance to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, specifically concerning water management.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Water Scarcity:** Cyprus faces scarce and expensive water resources due to variable rainfall and frequent droughts.
*   **Comprehensive Approach:** Cypriot authorities have adopted a comprehensive approach to water resource planning, recognizing the interrelationships between surface and groundwater and the demand for drinking and irrigation water.
*   **Demand Management:** Cyprus has implemented demand management programs, including pricing, rationing, and technical conservation measures.
*   **Future Shortages:** Serious and growing water shortages are projected over the next 25 years (from 1995).
*   **Demand Increase:** Total water demand is expected to increase from 215 MCM in 1994 to 294 MCM in 2020, with municipal and industrial (M&I) demand increasing from 25% to 33% of total demand.
