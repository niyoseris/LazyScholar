## Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in Cyprus: Analysis of Climate Policy

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Climate Policy Cyprus)

*   **Emissions Reduction:** Cyprus achieved a net emissions reduction of 5.6% compared to 2005 (data until 2023). Total emissions decreased by 4.7% between 2005 and 2023.
*   **Effort Sharing vs. ETS:** Emissions from sectors covered by effort-sharing legislation have increased by 7.9% since 2005, while emissions from sectors under the EU emissions trading system (ETS) decreased by 14.9% over the same period.
*   **Climate Neutrality Target:** Cyprus intends to reach zero net emissions in 2050, but progress appears insufficient.
*   **NECP:** The European Commission assessed Cyprus's draft updated national energy and climate plan (NECP) and made recommendations. The final updated NECP was submitted in December 2024.
*   **NRRP and Green Transition:** Almost half of Cyprus's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), including a REPowerEU chapter, is dedicated to the green transition, focusing on energy and transport.
*   **Public Perception:** A 2023 survey indicated that 39% of Cypriots identified climate change as a major global problem, with most expecting the government, businesses, and the EU to take action.
*   **Long-Term Strategy (LTS):** Cyprus updated its long-term low GHG emissions development strategy in 2022, but without specifying an overall LTS goal by 2050. A review is planned in view of the 'fit for 55' package and REPowerEU.
*   **National Adaptation Strategy (NAS):** Cyprus adopted a national adaptation strategy (NAS) and action plan in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The strategy is under revision, with the second NAS expected in 2025.
*   **Renewable Energy:** Cyprus surpassed its 2020 target for renewable energy share in final energy consumption. In 2023, the renewable energy share in Cyprus's final energy consumption reached 20.7%.
*   **Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI):** Cyprus ranks 44th in the 2025 CCPI, receiving 'medium', 'low', and 'very low' ratings in GHG emissions and energy use, renewable energy, and climate policy, respectively.
*   **Governance Structure:** Cyprus has a national governance system for climate and energy, which has been expanded to include the Green Deal. A ministerial committee recommends policies to the Council of Ministers.
*   **Adaptation Challenges:** The current institutional framework for adaptation is considered weak, and the non-binding approach to adaptation poses challenges.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Mixed Progress:** Cyprus shows some progress in emissions reduction and renewable energy adoption, but faces challenges in meeting its climate neutrality target and addressing emissions from effort-sharing sectors.
*   **Policy Gaps:** The lack of a specific overall LTS goal by 2050 in the 2022 strategy update suggests a potential policy gap.
*   **Importance of NRRP:** The significant allocation of NRRP funds to the green transition highlights the importance of this plan in achieving climate objectives.
*   **Public Awareness:** The relatively low percentage of Cypriots identifying climate change as a major problem compared to the EU average suggests a need for increased public awareness campaigns.
*   **Adaptation Urgency:** The emphasis on adaptation policy reflects the vulnerability of Cyprus to climate change impacts, particularly water scarcity and extreme weather events.
*   **Governance Weakness:** The identified weakness in the institutional framework for adaptation and the non-binding approach raise concerns about the effectiveness of adaptation measures.
*   **Energy Dependence:** The high dependence on imported fossil fuels underscores the need for diversification and increased renewable energy production.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **NRRP Projects:** Examples of NRRP projects include connecting Cyprus to the EU electricity network, promoting energy efficiency investments in SMEs and the public sector, and deploying smart metering infrastructure.
*   **Renewable Energy Deployment:** The significant increase in solar capacity, particularly photovoltaics, is a notable example of renewable energy deployment in Cyprus.

### 4. Conclusions

Cyprus is taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, but faces significant challenges. While the country has made progress in reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy adoption, it needs to strengthen its climate policies, particularly in the areas of long-term strategy, adaptation governance, and public awareness. The NRRP provides a valuable opportunity to accelerate the green transition, but its effectiveness will depend on the successful implementation of planned measures and reforms. The identified weaknesses in the institutional framework for adaptation need to be addressed to ensure that Cyprus is adequately prepared for the impacts of climate change.

*   **Renewable Energy Targets:** Cyprus proposes targets of a 28.8% renewable share in final energy consumption by 2030 in its final updated NECP.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Mixed Progress:** Cyprus has made some progress in reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy use, but faces challenges in meeting its climate neutrality target. The increase in emissions from effort-sharing sectors is a concern.
*   **Policy Implementation Gaps:** The "very low" rating in climate policy by the CCPI suggests weaknesses in the design or implementation of climate policies.
*   **Governance Challenges:** The text highlights a "weak" institutional framework and a "non-binding approach to adaptation" as key governance challenges.
*   **Reliance on EU Funding:** The significant portion of the NRRP dedicated to climate action indicates a reliance on EU funding for achieving climate goals.
*   **Public Awareness:** The lower-than-EU-average public concern about climate change may hinder the implementation of ambitious climate policies.
*   **Adaptation Imperative:** The emphasis on adaptation policy reflects the vulnerability of Cyprus to climate change impacts, particularly water scarcity and extreme weather events.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **NRRP Projects:** Examples include projects aimed at promoting energy efficiency investments in SMEs and deploying smart metering infrastructure.
*   **Cross-Border Interconnector:** The plan contributes to connecting Cyprus to the EU electricity network as part of a broader investment intended to build a cross-border interconnector between Cyprus, Greece, and Israel.
*   **Renewable Energy Deployment:** Significant increase in deployment of solar capacity, in particular photovoltaics.

### 4. Conclusions

Cyprus is taking steps to address climate change, but faces significant challenges. While emissions have been reduced and renewable energy adoption has increased, progress towards climate neutrality is considered insufficient. Key areas for improvement include strengthening climate policies, enhancing the institutional framework for adaptation, and increasing public awareness and engagement. The country's reliance on EU funding and the need to address emissions from effort-sharing sectors are also critical considerations. The updated NECP and NAS will be crucial in guiding Cyprus's future climate action.
