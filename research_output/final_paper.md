## Abstract

This research paper examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change on Cyprus, an island nation in the Eastern Mediterranean, recognized as a climate change "hotspot." The study synthesizes existing literature and reports to analyze the environmental, socioeconomic, and policy dimensions of climate change in Cyprus. Key environmental impacts include sea-level rise, exacerbating coastal erosion and threatening maritime boundaries; increasing water scarcity due to declining precipitation and rising temperatures; and the heightened frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Socioeconomic consequences encompass the vulnerability of the tourism and agricultural sectors, as well as potential public health challenges. The paper also explores Cyprus's mitigation and adaptation strategies, focusing on renewable energy deployment, integrated water management, and climate policy frameworks. The findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive and integrated climate action to safeguard Cyprus's environment, economy, and public health.

## Introduction

Cyprus, an island state located in the Eastern Mediterranean, is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Its geographical location places it within a region identified as a climate change "hotspot" by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This designation implies that Cyprus is projected to experience more pronounced effects of climate change compared to many other regions globally. These effects include rising temperatures, declining precipitation, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and sea-level rise. These changes pose significant challenges to the island's environment, economy, and public health. This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the climate change affects on Cyprus, examining the environmental and socioeconomic impacts, as well as the mitigation and adaptation strategies being implemented. By synthesizing existing research and reports, this study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing Cyprus in the context of a changing climate.

## Main Content

### Environmental Impacts of Climate Change in Cyprus

#### Sea Level Rise Cyprus

Cyprus, as an island nation, is acutely aware of the threat posed by climate-induced sea-level rise. Rising sea levels endanger coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems. The country emphasizes adherence to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and advocates for the use of permanent baselines to protect its maritime boundaries and legal entitlements in the face of coastal erosion. Cyprus argues against the application of the principle of *rebus sic stantibus* to maritime boundaries affected by sea-level rise, citing Article 62(2)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The nation views sea-level rise as a significant threat requiring international attention and legal clarification.

#### Water Scarcity Cyprus

Cyprus experiences the highest water stress level in Europe, a situation exacerbated by droughts, urbanization, and population growth. Climate change is projected to worsen the existing water resource situation, affecting surface water, groundwater, rivers, lakes, coastal waters, and aquifers. The Eastern Mediterranean region, including Cyprus, faces increasing aridity and a significant threat of desertification. Agriculture is the largest water consumer, accounting for 64% of the island's water resources. Integrated policy approaches, including demand management, alternative water sources (desalination and recycled water), and regional collaboration, are crucial for addressing water scarcity. The country is committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all).

#### Extreme Weather Cyprus

The Eastern Mediterranean region, including Cyprus, is identified as a climate change hotspot, projected to experience a combined effect of warming and drying. Global warming is expected to induce changes in extreme rainfall events, affecting their duration and magnitude. Most extreme precipitation indicators are projected to decrease on average for the island, suggesting a transition to drier conditions. Absolute daily rainfall maxima exhibit strong local variability, highlighting the need for high-resolution simulations to understand potential impacts on future flooding. High-resolution regional climate simulations are essential for accurately assessing changes in precipitation, especially in regions with complex topography and coastlines like Cyprus.

### Socioeconomic Impacts of Climate Change in Cyprus

#### Tourism Climate Change Cyprus

The tourism sector, particularly coastal tourism in Cyprus, is highly vulnerable to climate change. Tourists value adaptation measures related to beach protection, heatwave amelioration, water supply, and infectious disease prevention. Cyprus is experiencing increasing temperatures and drier conditions due to climate change, which are projected to worsen, particularly during the warm season. Effective climate change adaptation policies are necessary to mitigate the significant impact on coastal tourism. Higher summer temperatures may lead to a gradual decrease in summer tourism but an increase in spring and autumn tourism, potentially lengthening and flattening the tourism season.

#### Agriculture Climate Change Cyprus

Cyprus's National Adaptation Strategy includes a National Action Plan with specific adaptation measures for the agricultural sector. The strategy recognizes the vulnerability of Cyprus's agriculture to climate change and aims to enhance the capacity to adapt. The focus is on improving water use efficiency, promoting climate-resilient crops, and providing farmers with the knowledge and tools to adapt. The Cyprus Initiative recognizes the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region, including Cyprus, as a climate change "hotspot." The National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) includes vulnerability assessments and adaptation measures in water resources, forests, and biodiversity, all crucial for agriculture.

#### Public Health Climate Change Cyprus

The Cypriot public recognizes the link between climate change and human health. A significant portion of respondents believe that health issues like asthma, cancer, obesity, type II diabetes, and high blood pressure would become more frequent due to environmental factors, including climate change. Women were more likely than men to perceive that environmental factors like temperature rise, extreme weather events, and air pollution are significantly influenced by climate change. Cyprus has high levels of air pollution and faces challenges related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). There is a critical need for improved data collection and monitoring of climate change impacts on public health in Cyprus.

### Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies in Cyprus

#### Renewable Energy Cyprus

Cyprus has high electricity prices due to reliance on liquid fuel. Renewable energy offers a way to reduce both the cost and environmental impact of electricity generation. Solar PV and wind power will play a major role in the roadmap to 2030. The government of Cyprus now has an energy planning model to quantify the possible pace and benefits of renewable energy deployment. Cyprus has already overachieved its binding 13% national Renewable Energy Sources (RES) target, reaching 17.0%. Increased renewable electricity penetration, particularly solar photovoltaics combined with energy storage, can dramatically reduce energy costs and enhance energy independence.

#### Water Management Cyprus

Cyprus faces water scarcity due to its semi-arid climate and limited water resources. Water demand is increasing due to population growth, tourism, and increased living standards. Groundwater resources are overexploited, leading to saline water intrusion and quality deterioration. A shift towards integrated water management, conservation, and alternative water sources (desalination, treated wastewater) is crucial for ensuring a sustainable water supply. The establishment of a new Directory for Integrated Water Management is proposed to address the fragmented responsibilities and promote a holistic approach.

#### Climate Policy Cyprus

Cyprus aims to participate proportionately in the EU's commitment to a climate-neutral economy by 2050, aligning with the European Green Deal. The long-term strategy is complementary to the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP). The strategy emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate technological solutions and continuing successful policies during the period 2030-2040. Cyprus has a national governance system for climate and energy, which has been expanded to include the Green Deal. A ministerial committee recommends policies to the Council of Ministers.

## Conclusion

Climate change poses significant and multifaceted challenges to Cyprus. The island nation faces environmental threats such as sea-level rise, water scarcity, and extreme weather events, which in turn impact key socioeconomic sectors like tourism and agriculture, as well as public health. While Cyprus has made progress in developing mitigation and adaptation strategies, including promoting renewable energy, implementing integrated water management, and establishing climate policy frameworks, further action is needed. The success of these strategies will depend on effective implementation, integration with other policy areas, and adaptation to evolving scientific knowledge and international developments. Addressing the identified governance weaknesses and increasing public awareness are also crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Cyprus in the face of climate change.
