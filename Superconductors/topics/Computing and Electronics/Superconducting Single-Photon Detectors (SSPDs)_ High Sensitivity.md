*   **High Quantum Efficiency (QE):** SSPDs aim for QE approaching 100% across a broad spectrum (200 nm to >3000 nm). Achieved QE is ~25-20% for visible light and ~8-4% for 1.3-1.55 µm at T = 4.2 K, improving to ~30% and ~20% respectively at T = 2.0 K.
*   **Low Dark Count Rates:** SSPDs exhibit low dark count rates (<10 Hz at 4.2 K, <10^-3 Hz at 2.0 K), minimizing false detections.
*   **High Speed:** SSPDs offer fast, picosecond signal rise and recovery times, enabling high counting rates with minimal dead time.
*   **Energy Resolution:** SSPDs possess the capability to resolve the energy of detected photons through statistical analysis of the quantum efficiency dependence on absorbed photon energy. Wavelength resolution of 50 nm was achieved.
*   **Photon Number Resolution:** SSPDs, when coupled with high-input impedance cryogenic HEMT read-out circuits, can resolve the number of photons detected simultaneously.
*   **Polarization Sensitivity:** The geometry of SSPDs leads to polarization dependence of photon absorption and quantum efficiency, enabling their use as polarization discriminators.
