*   **Iron-Based Superconductors:** Iron-based superconductors with Tc up to 56 K are also considered HTS.
*   **Unconventional Mechanisms:** The origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still unclear, but it seems that instead of electron-phonon attraction mechanisms, as in conventional superconductivity, one is dealing with genuine electronic mechanisms (e.g. by antiferromagnetic correlations), and instead of s-wave pairing, d-waves are substantial.
*   **Cuprate Structure:** Cuprates are quasi-two-dimensional materials with superconductivity occurring in copper-oxide (CuO2) layers.

This suggests that research should focus not only on increasing Tc but also on improving other critical parameters.
