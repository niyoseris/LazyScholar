## Introduction

Superconductivity, the phenomenon of zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature, has captivated scientists and engineers since its discovery in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (Onnes, 1911). While initial applications were limited by the extremely low temperatures required for conventional superconductors, the discovery of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in the 1980s, materials exhibiting superconductivity at temperatures achievable with liquid nitrogen, sparked renewed interest and broadened the potential for practical applications (Bednorz & Müller, 1986). This paper explores the future use cases of superconductors, focusing on the transformative impact they could have across various sectors, while acknowledging the persistent materials science and engineering challenges that must be overcome to realize their full potential.

The promise of lossless energy transmission and storage is perhaps the most compelling driver for superconductor research. Current power grids suffer significant energy losses due to resistive heating in conventional conductors (Barnes, 2010). Superconducting cables, capable of transmitting electricity with virtually no loss, offer a pathway to significantly improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions (Hsu et al., 2015). Furthermore, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems, which store energy in a magnetic field generated by a superconducting coil, present a promising solution for grid-scale energy storage, enabling the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind power (Luongo et al., 2011). This paper will delve into the advancements in superconducting cable technology and SMES systems, examining their potential to revolutionize energy infrastructure.

Beyond energy, superconductors hold immense promise for revolutionizing transportation. Superconducting magnets are crucial components of Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains, enabling high-speed, frictionless transportation (Goodall, 2000). The development of more robust and cost-effective superconducting magnets is essential for the widespread adoption of Maglev technology. Furthermore, superconductors are being explored for use in electric motors and generators for aircraft and ships, offering significant weight and efficiency advantages compared to conventional technologies (Hwang et al., 2018). This section will analyze the current state of superconducting transportation technologies and explore the potential for future advancements.

The medical field stands to benefit significantly from the unique properties of superconductors. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relies heavily on superconducting magnets to generate strong, uniform magnetic fields for high-resolution imaging (Bottomley, 2003). Advancements in superconducting magnet technology could lead to smaller, more affordable, and higher-field MRI systems, improving diagnostic capabilities. Furthermore, superconductors are being investigated for use in novel medical devices, such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) for highly sensitive biomagnetic measurements and targeted drug delivery systems (Clarke & Braginski, 2004). This paper will explore the current and future applications of superconductors in medical imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

The realm of computing and electronics is another area where superconductors could have a profound impact. Superconducting electronics offer the potential for ultra-fast, low-power computing, surpassing the limitations of conventional semiconductor-based technologies (Likharev, 1986). Superconducting digital circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, offer the possibility of building extremely fast and energy-efficient processors (Herr, 2007). Furthermore, superconductors are being explored for use in quantum computing, where their unique quantum properties can be harnessed to build powerful quantum computers (Nielsen & Chuang, 2010). This section will examine the potential of superconducting electronics and quantum computing, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

Finally, superconductors are finding increasing applications in various industrial processes. High-field superconducting magnets are used in mineral separation, materials processing, and fusion energy research (Weggel, 2002). The development of more robust and cost-effective superconducting magnets is crucial for expanding their use in these and other industrial applications. This paper will also address the significant materials science and engineering challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of superconducting technologies. These challenges include the brittleness of HTS materials, the difficulty in fabricating long lengths of superconducting wire, and the need for improved cooling systems (Hull, 2011). Overcoming these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of superconductors and ushering in a new era of technological innovation. By examining these diverse applications and the associated challenges, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the future use cases of superconductors and their potential to transform various aspects of modern society.

Consequently, cold dielectric cables exhibit lower electrical losses than their warm dielectric counterparts (deluc, 2011).
*   **Triaxial Design:** A specialized configuration of cold dielectric cable, the triaxial design features three-phase conductors arranged concentrically (deluc, 2011).
*   **Cooling System Criticality:** The design of the cooling system is paramount for maintaining LN2 in its liquid state. Careful consideration must be given to hydraulic diameter, cable length, and overall system losses (deluc, 2011).
*   **Fault Current Considerations:** Superconducting cables possess very low impedance, which can lead to substantial fault currents. The cable design must accommodate these high currents to prevent LN2 boiling during fault events (deluc, 2011).

### 2. Analysis and Insights

The project focuses on reducing costs, improving efficiency, and demonstrating the technology's scalability and grid compatibility (Jordan Morris, 2021). The potential benefits include improved asset utilization, enhanced grid reliability, reduced environmental impact, and support for renewable energy integration (Jordan Morris, 2021). The integration of SMES into Smart Grids offers significant advantages in addressing grid faults and improving overall grid performance (39783, 2014). The phased development approach and collaboration with industry partners increase the likelihood of successful deployment and commercialization of SMES technology (Jordan Morris, 2021).

### High-Capacity Superconducting Transformers

This section analyzes recent literature pertaining to high-capacity superconducting transformers, a critical component in modern energy transmission and storage systems. The analysis focuses on the potential benefits, technological advancements, and challenges associated with the implementation of this technology.

### 1. Performance Advantages of High-Capacity Superconducting Transformers

High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) transformers offer significant advantages over conventional transformers. These include the potential for reduced losses (30% reduction), lower weight (45% reduction), and a lower total cost of ownership (20% reduction) (Badin, 2000). Furthermore, HTS transformers can operate at 10 to 30 times greater current density than conventional transformers (Badin, 2000). This increased current density, coupled with the near-zero resistance of superconducting materials, contributes to enhanced efficiency and reduced energy waste. Beyond efficiency, HTS transformers offer unprecedented fault current limiting functionality, which can protect and reduce the cost of utility system components (Badin, 2000). The reduced operating impedance also improves network voltage regulation (Badin, 2000). Environmentally, HTS transformers eliminate the need for oil cooling, mitigating fire and environmental hazards (Badin, 2000). Their compact design, stemming from higher power densities, allows for siting in high-density urban areas and inside buildings (Badin, 2000). Finally, HTS transformers exhibit superior overload capability, capable of carrying up to 200% of their nameplate rating indefinitely without loss of transformer life (Badin, 2000).

### 2. Enabling Technologies and System-Level Impacts

The development of affordable HTS wires that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures is a key enabler for HTS transformer technology (Badin, 2000). These materials, such as yttrium barium copper oxide and bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, have revolutionized the field (Omics, 2025). Coated conductor wires, in particular, are crucial for creating compact and efficient high-capacity transformers (Omics, 2025). The system-level impact of HTS transformers is significant. By reducing impedance and providing fault current limiting capabilities, they can improve power system performance and operation (Badin, 2000). This can lead to reduced costs for breakers, load tap changers, static VAR compensation, and capacitor banks, as well as potential revenue increases due to improved generator capacity (Badin, 2000).

### 3. Case Studies and Experimental Results

While widespread adoption is still underway, several examples demonstrate the potential of HTS transformers. Engineers from Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. (RG&E) recognize the benefits of HTS transformers in terms of smaller size, extended overload capability, and the elimination of fire and environmental hazards (Badin, 2000). They also highlight the potential to reduce transformer ratings or increase capacity within the same footprint (Badin, 2000). Furthermore, experimental HTS transformers have been developed for specialized applications. Shirshov et al. (2010) describe the development of two superconducting transformer systems designed to measure the critical current and minimal quench energy of superconducting cables. These systems utilize an inductive method to energize the sample, reducing liquid helium losses (Shirshov et al., 2010). Both transformer designs are capable of generating high currents in the secondary superconducting coil, reaching 18.6 kA for the race-track coil design and 15.3 kA for the solenoid design (Shirshov et al., 2010).

### 4. Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the promising advantages, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of HTS transformers. General acceptance will depend on system performance, efficiency, reliability, maintenance, operational lifetime, and installed cost compared to conventional technologies (Badin, 2000). Full-scale demonstrations are needed to accelerate the acceptance of superconducting technologies and open up global markets (Badin, 2000). The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) supports the development and adoption of HTS electric power devices through initiatives like the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) (Badin, 2000). Further research and development are crucial to fully realize the potential of superconducting transformers and integrate them into existing infrastructure (Omics, 2025).

## Transportation

### Maglev Trains: Speed and Efficiency

Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains represent a significant advancement in transportation technology, primarily distinguished by their potential for high speeds and enhanced efficiency compared to conventional rail systems. The fundamental principle behind maglev technology involves the use of magnetic fields to levitate, propel, and guide the train along a guideway (often referred to as a track). This contactless operation eliminates the friction associated with traditional wheel-on-rail systems, a key factor contributing to the superior speed capabilities of maglev trains.

The absence of physical contact between the train and the guideway not only reduces friction but also minimizes wear and tear on both the vehicle and the infrastructure. This reduction in mechanical stress translates to lower maintenance requirements and potentially longer lifespans for maglev systems. Furthermore, the streamlined aerodynamic design of maglev trains, coupled with the efficient use of electric propulsion, contributes to improved energy efficiency at high speeds. While the initial construction costs of maglev infrastructure can be substantial, the long-term operational benefits, including reduced maintenance and potentially lower energy consumption per passenger-mile, warrant consideration in the context of sustainable transportation solutions.

The potential for high-speed travel is perhaps the most widely recognized advantage of maglev technology. Existing maglev systems have demonstrated the capability to achieve speeds exceeding 500 km/h (approximately 310 mph), significantly faster than conventional high-speed rail. This speed advantage can dramatically reduce travel times between major urban centers, fostering economic growth and enhancing connectivity. However, the widespread adoption of maglev technology faces challenges, including the high initial investment costs, the need for dedicated infrastructure, and public perception regarding safety and reliability. Future research and development efforts should focus on addressing these challenges to unlock the full potential of maglev trains as a viable and efficient mode of transportation.

### Superconducting Ship Propulsion

The marine industry is facing increasing demands for alternative propulsion systems driven by factors such as expanding global trade, the need for enhanced transportation efficiency, requirements for higher power outputs, greater operational flexibility, and escalating fuel costs (Dell, 2012). Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) propulsion, particularly when coupled with superconducting technology, presents a potentially viable alternative to conventional propeller-based systems (Dell, 2012). This section analyzes the principles, advantages, challenges, and historical context of superconducting MHD propulsion for ships.

### Principles and Advantages of MHD Propulsion

MHD propulsion operates on the fundamental principle of the Lorentz force, which arises from the interaction between electric and magnetic fields within a conductive fluid, in this case, seawater (Dell, 2012). By passing an electric current through seawater subjected to a strong magnetic field, a force is generated that propels the water, and consequently the vessel, forward. Superconducting magnets are crucial for generating the intense magnetic fields necessary for effective MHD propulsion, as they can carry significantly higher current densities compared to conventional copper wires (Dell, 2012). This allows for the creation of stronger magnetic fields within a smaller volume.

MHD thrusters offer several potential advantages over traditional propulsion methods. These include the absence of rotating parts, which reduces susceptibility to cavitation, making them suitable for high-speed vessels (Dell, 2012). Furthermore, MHD systems can potentially operate silently, a characteristic highly desirable for specialized vessels (Dell, 2012). The design flexibility of MHD thrusters, in terms of configuration and size, also allows for optimization of propulsive performance (Dell, 2012). Finally, the elimination of shafting simplifies the overall mechanical design of the ship (Dell, 2012).

### MHD Thruster Configurations and Design Considerations

Several configurations for superconducting MHD thrusters have been proposed, including outer magnetic field systems and inner magnetic field systems, where the magnets are installed inside the ship's hull for shielding purposes (Dell, 2012). Furthermore, MHD thruster systems can be categorized into inner ducting, annular ducting, and pod-mounted types (Dell, 2012). The selection of a specific configuration involves trade-offs between factors such as hydraulic drag, electromagnetic field volume, and overall propulsive efficiency (Dell, 2012). The electromagnetic field is typically generated by superconducting coils made of Niobium-Titanium (NbTi) wires (Dell, 2012).

### Challenges and Limitations

Despite its potential advantages, MHD propulsion faces several technological challenges. The propulsive efficiency of MHD systems is currently limited by the electrical conductivity of seawater and the capabilities of existing superconducting technology (Dell, 2012). Overcoming the low electrical conductivity of seawater requires the generation of extremely strong magnetic fields, which places stringent demands on the superconducting magnets.

### The YAMATO-1: A Case Study in Superconducting MHD Propulsion

The "YAMATO-1," a full-scale experimental MHD ship built in Japan in 1991, represents a significant milestone in the development of superconducting MHD propulsion (19960000249, 2008). This project, motivated by the successful application of superconducting magnets in MAGLEV trains, aimed to investigate the feasibility of applying MHD thruster systems to actual ships (19960000249, 2008). The YAMATO-1 served as a valuable platform for evaluating the performance and operational characteristics of MHD propulsion in a real-world marine environment.

### Conclusions

Superconducting MHD propulsion holds promise as an alternative ship propulsion system, particularly for applications requiring high speed and silent operation (Dell, 2012). However, the technology faces challenges related to the electrical conductivity of seawater and the limitations of current superconducting technology (Dell, 2012). The YAMATO-1 experiment represents a significant step in exploring the feasibility of this technology (19960000249, 2008). Further research and development are needed to improve the efficiency and practicality of superconducting MHD ship propulsion.

Airbus is actively pursuing superconducting technology for hydrogen-powered aircraft, demonstrating a strong commitment to this area (Berne, 2024). This initiative is driven by the potential for significant performance improvements, particularly in terms of weight and fuel savings, which are crucial for the viability of hydrogen-powered flight (Berne, 2024). A key component of this research is the Cryoprop demonstrator, launched by Airbus UpNext. This demonstrator features a megawatt-class superconducting motor, representing a significant advancement in scale compared to previous demonstrators. The Cryoprop demonstrator will integrate and mature a two megawatt-class superconducting electric propulsion system cooled by liquid hydrogen via a helium recirculation loop. Furthermore, Airbus aims to develop in-house expertise and foster a new ecosystem for superconducting technologies, including cables, motors, cryogenic power electronics, and cooling systems.

### 2. Cryocooler Requirements for Superconducting Aircraft Motors

While Airbus's research focuses on the development of superconducting motors, the successful implementation of these technologies in aircraft necessitates addressing the challenges associated with cryogenic cooling. NASA's research highlights the stringent requirements for cryocoolers in aircraft applications (NASA, 2011; NASA, 2012). Specifically, NASA aims to reduce airport noise, emissions, and fuel burn in future aircraft (N+3 generation, ~2030) using superconducting motors as a key component of the distributed turboelectric propulsion concept (NASA, 2011; NASA, 2012). This concept utilizes superconducting motors to drive propulsor fans distributed across the wings, powered by superconducting generators driven by high-speed gas turbines. This decouples speed and torque, offering control advantages.

### 3. Challenges and Technological Gaps

The development of efficient and lightweight cryocoolers is crucial for the successful implementation of superconducting generators and motors in future aircraft (NASA, 2011; NASA, 2012). Existing cryocooler technology needs significant improvement in terms of efficiency and specific mass to meet the demands of superconducting aircraft motors. NASA's research indicates that net refrigeration powers of 5 kW to 10 kW at 50 K to
