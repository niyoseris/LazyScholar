## Aspartame Consumption Surveys During Pregnancy

The consumption of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS), including aspartame, is increasing among women and children in the US (Source information not provided). Studies indicate that a significant proportion of pregnant women consume LCS-containing products. For instance, nearly half of women with gestational diabetes in the Danish National Birth Cohort reported consuming LCS beverages during pregnancy, with 9.3% consuming them daily (Source information not provided). This daily consumption has been positively associated with large birth size and increased risk of overweight/obesity in offspring at 7 years of age (Source information not provided). Similarly, in the Canadian CHILD birth cohort, maternal consumption of non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) beverages, including aspartame, during pregnancy was assessed in relation to offspring body composition. The study found that children of mothers who regularly consumed NNS beverages during pregnancy had a higher body mass index, suggesting a potential link between maternal aspartame consumption and increased risk of obesity in children (Source information not provided).

The safety of LCS consumption during pregnancy and lactation is a subject of ongoing investigation (Source information not provided). While some studies suggest a potential association between high aspartame intake during pregnancy and adverse outcomes such as preterm birth or low birth weight, others have found no significant correlation between maternal aspartame consumption and fetal outcomes (Azad et al., 2016). Azad et al. (2016) also reported that maternal consumption of artificially sweetened beverages during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity in children.

Animal studies have also explored the effects of aspartame consumption during pregnancy. One study investigated whether low-dose aspartame (5–7 mg/kg/day) or stevia (2–3 mg/kg/day) consumption during pregnancy and lactation alters glucose tolerance and gut microbiota in obese rats (Source information not provided). In this study, rats were fed a high-fat/sucrose diet to induce obesity and then randomized to receive either water, aspartame, or stevia in their drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation (Source information not provided). Another study used a similar experimental design, comparing the effects of aspartame and stevia consumption on gut microbiota and metabolic outcomes in dams and offspring (Source information not provided). These studies highlight the need for further research to fully understand the potential effects of aspartame consumption during pregnancy on both maternal and offspring health. Given the conflicting findings and potential implications, it is important for pregnant women to discuss their concerns about aspartame consumption with healthcare professionals and adhere to recommended guidelines for a healthy diet during pregnancy (Source information not provided).
