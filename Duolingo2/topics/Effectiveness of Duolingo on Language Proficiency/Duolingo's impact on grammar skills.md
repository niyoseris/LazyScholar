## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Grammar Skills

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on language proficiency, specifically grammar skills:

**1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Grammar Skills):**

*   The provided text does not explicitly mention findings related to grammar skills. The focus appears to be on lexical and oral fluency.
*   The text mentions "Overall Proficiency" which *could* include a grammar component, but without further details, it's impossible to determine the extent to which grammar was assessed or impacted.
*   The literature review section might contain information on SLA principles and how Duolingo adheres to them, which could indirectly relate to grammar. However, the provided excerpt doesn't offer specifics.

**2. Analysis and Insights:**

*   **Company Claims:** The paper highlights Duolingo's claims of being "free," "fun," "effective," and "high quality." The analysis of "effective" might contain some insights into how Duolingo *claims* to improve language skills, which could include grammar.
*   **Lack of Integration of MALL:** The paper mentions a lack of integration of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL). This could imply that Duolingo, as a MALL tool, might not be fully integrated into traditional language learning curricula, potentially affecting its impact on grammar instruction.
*   **Potential Drawbacks of MALL:** The paper lists potential drawbacks of MALL, including "Irrelevance to Classroom Topics" and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles." If Duolingo's grammar instruction is irrelevant to classroom learning or doesn't adhere to established SLA principles, its effectiveness on grammar skills could be limited.
*   **Previous Studies on Duolingo:** This section is crucial. It *should* contain information on how previous research has assessed Duolingo's impact on various language skills, including grammar. However, the provided text doesn't give any details of these studies.

**3. Examples or Case Studies:**

*   The provided text does not include any specific examples or case studies related to Duolingo's impact on grammar skills.

**4. Conclusions:**

*   Based on the provided text alone, it's impossible to draw any definitive conclusions about Duolingo's impact on grammar skills. The text sets the stage for an investigation but doesn't present any concrete findings. The "Results" section only mentions lexical and oral fluency, and overall proficiency.

**Summary of Relevant Sections (Based on Table of Contents):**

*   **Introduction:** Provides background on CALL, MALL, and Duolingo. The analysis of Duolingo's claims ("Effective," "High Quality") might offer insights.
*   **Literature Review:** This is a critical section. Look for information on:
    *   Second Language Acquisition (SLA) Theory: How grammar is typically learned.
    *   CALL and MALL: How these approaches align with SLA principles for grammar instruction.
    *   Previous Studies on Duolingo: What existing research says about Duolingo's impact on grammar.
*   **Methodology:** How the study was conducted. This will be important to understand the validity of any findings related to grammar.
*   **Results:** This section *should* contain the study's findings. Look for any data related to grammar, even if it's part of an "Overall Proficiency" score.
*   **Discussion/Conclusion (Not in provided text):** This section will interpret the results and draw conclusions about Duolingo's effectiveness.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Obtain the full paper:** The provided text is only a partial excerpt. Accessing the complete dissertation is essential.
2.  **Focus on the Literature Review and Results sections:** These sections are most likely to contain information relevant to the research question.
3.  **Look for specific keywords:** When searching within the full paper, use keywords like "grammar," "syntax," "morphology," "sentence structure," and "accuracy."
4.  **Examine the methodology:** Understand how grammar skills were assessed in the study. Was it through explicit grammar tests, error analysis of writing samples, or some other method?

## Analysis of Duolingo's Impact on Grammar Skills Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts relevant information from Robert Charles Schroeder's 2021 thesis, "Duolingo and HelloTalk: Analyzing and Evaluating Language Learning Applications Using SLA Theory and User Feedback," focusing specifically on Duolingo's impact on grammar skills.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Grammar Skills

*   **Oversimplified Grammar Instruction:** Users generally rated Duolingo well in most areas, but it was rarely rated as excellent due to oversimplified grammar instruction.
*   **Poor Focus on Form:** The app demonstrates a poor focus on form, particularly in terms of pronunciation.
*   **Vocabulary Strength, Grammar Weakness:** Duolingo's strength lies in vocabulary acquisition for specific contexts and scenarios, but grammar instruction is a significant weakness.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **SLA Principles:** The study uses established Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo. The findings suggest that while Duolingo may be effective for vocabulary acquisition, its approach to grammar may not align well with effective SLA practices.
*   **User Frustration:** The oversimplified grammar instruction and lack of focus on form contribute to user frustration. This suggests that users recognize the importance of grammar and are dissatisfied with Duolingo's approach.
*   **Focus on Form:** The study highlights the importance of "focus on form" in language learning, which Duolingo seems to lack. This suggests that explicit grammar instruction and attention to grammatical accuracy are crucial for language proficiency.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The abstract mentions a survey and interviews were conducted, but specific examples or case studies related to grammar are not provided in the abstract or table of contents. The appendices are not included in the provided text.

### 4. Conclusions

*   **Duolingo's Limitations:** The study concludes that Duolingo has limitations, particularly in the area of grammar instruction.
*   **Implications for App Developers:** The findings have implications for app developers, suggesting a need to improve grammar instruction and focus on form.
*   **Implications for App Users:** The findings also have implications for app users, suggesting that Duolingo may not be sufficient for developing strong grammar skills and that supplementary resources may be needed.
