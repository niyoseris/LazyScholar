## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Writing Skills

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on the effectiveness of Duolingo on language proficiency, specifically its impact on writing skills:

**1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Writing Skills):**

*   The provided text does not contain specific findings related to the impact of Duolingo on writing skills. The "RESULTS" section mentions "Written Fluency," suggesting that the study did assess this skill. However, the provided excerpt ends abruptly before presenting any data or analysis related to written fluency.
*   The text mentions "Overall Proficiency," which could potentially include a writing component, but without further context, it's impossible to determine the extent to which writing was assessed.

**2. Analysis and Insights:**

*   **Lack of Integration of MALL:** The introduction mentions a lack of integration of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) into formal education. This suggests a potential gap in how Duolingo (as a MALL tool) is used to develop comprehensive language skills, including writing.
*   **Potential Drawbacks of MALL:** The text lists potential drawbacks of MALL, including "Unvaried Tasks" and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles." These drawbacks could negatively impact the development of writing skills if Duolingo's exercises are repetitive or don't align with effective language learning strategies for writing.
*   **Company Claims:** The introduction discusses Duolingo's claims of being "Effective" and "High quality." The research likely aims to investigate the validity of these claims, including whether Duolingo is effective in improving writing skills.

**3. Examples or Case Studies:**

*   The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies related to writing skills. The study itself, as described in the "METHODOLOGY" section, seems to involve collecting data from participants using Duolingo and comparing their pre- and post-test scores.

**4. Conclusions:**

*   The provided text does not include any conclusions. The study's conclusions regarding writing skills would be found in the "RESULTS" and "DISCUSSION" sections, which are not included in this excerpt.

**Summary of Findings:**

The provided text suggests that the study investigated the impact of Duolingo on various language skills, including written fluency. However, the excerpt does not contain any specific findings, analysis, or conclusions related to writing skills. The text does highlight potential drawbacks of MALL and the need to critically evaluate Duolingo's claims of effectiveness.

## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Writing Skills

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on language proficiency, specifically its impact on writing skills:

**1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Writing Skills):**

*   The provided text does not explicitly mention findings related to Duolingo's impact on writing skills. The "RESULTS" section includes "Written Fluency," suggesting that the study did assess writing, but the specific findings are not included in the provided excerpt.

**2. Analysis and Insights:**

*   **Lack of Integration of MALL:** The text mentions a lack of integration of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) in general, which could imply that writing skills are not adequately addressed in MALL applications like Duolingo.
*   **Potential Drawbacks of MALL:** The text lists potential drawbacks of MALL, including "Unvaried Tasks" and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles." These drawbacks could negatively impact the development of writing skills if Duolingo's writing exercises are repetitive or do not align with effective language learning principles.
*   **Learning Outcomes and the Focus on Vocabulary Acquisition:** The text mentions that previous MALL studies often focus on vocabulary acquisition. This suggests that writing skills might be a less emphasized area in MALL research and potentially in Duolingo itself.

**3. Examples or Case Studies:**

*   The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies related to Duolingo's impact on writing skills.

**4. Conclusions:**

*   Based on the limited text, it's impossible to draw definitive conclusions about Duolingo's impact on writing skills. The text suggests that writing might be an area of weakness in MALL applications due to a lack of integration, unvaried tasks, and a focus on vocabulary acquisition. The "Written Fluency" section in the "RESULTS" suggests that the study did assess writing, but the results are not included in the provided excerpt.

**Further Research Directions (Based on the Text):**

*   **Examine the "RESULTS" section:** Obtain the full paper to analyze the "Written Fluency" results and understand the study's findings on Duolingo's impact on writing skills.
*   **Investigate Task Variety:** Analyze the types of writing tasks offered by Duolingo and assess their variety and alignment with SLA principles.
*   **Compare with Traditional Methods:** Compare the effectiveness of Duolingo's writing exercises with traditional writing instruction methods.
*   **Qualitative Data:** Explore qualitative data (e.g., student interviews) to understand learners' perceptions of Duolingo's impact on their writing abilities.

## Analysis of Duolingo and HelloTalk: Analyzing and Evaluating Language Learning Applications Using SLA Theory and User Feedback

Based on the provided text, here's an analysis focusing on Duolingo's impact on writing skills:

### 1. Key Findings Related to Duolingo and Writing Skills

*   The abstract mentions that Duolingo was generally rated well, but rarely as excellent in any category. This suggests potential weaknesses in certain areas.
*   The abstract specifically mentions "oversimplified grammar instruction" as a reason for lower ratings. This is relevant because grammar is foundational for effective writing.
*   The table of contents includes a section on "Focus on Form (FoF)," which is further broken down into subtopics. This suggests that the study investigated how Duolingo addresses grammar and other aspects of language form, which are crucial for writing.
*   The table of contents also includes a section on "Communicative Language," which is relevant to writing skills as writing is a form of communication.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The study uses established Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo. This provides a theoretical framework for understanding how the app might impact different language skills, including writing.
*   The study uses both surveys and interviews to gather user feedback. This mixed-methods approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of user experiences and perceptions of Duolingo's effectiveness.
*   The mention of "user frustration" in the abstract suggests that some aspects of Duolingo might hinder learning, potentially impacting writing skills if users become discouraged or develop incorrect habits.
*   The comparison with HelloTalk is important. HelloTalk's strengths and weaknesses can provide context for understanding Duolingo's relative effectiveness in developing writing skills.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The provided text does not contain specific examples or case studies. The appendices contain responses to survey questions, which may contain some examples, but these are not included in the provided text.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The abstract indicates that the study discusses the implications of its findings for app developers and users. This suggests that the conclusion will offer recommendations for improving Duolingo and for using it more effectively.
*   Based on the abstract, the study suggests that Duolingo's strength lies in vocabulary acquisition, but its weakness is grammar instruction. This implies that Duolingo may not be as effective for developing writing skills, which require a strong understanding of grammar.
*   The study's conclusion likely addresses the limitations of the research and suggests areas for future investigation. This could include more specific research on Duolingo's impact on writing skills, using writing samples as a measure of proficiency.
