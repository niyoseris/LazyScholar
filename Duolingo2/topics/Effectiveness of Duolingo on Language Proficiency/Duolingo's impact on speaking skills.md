## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Speaking Skills

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on speaking skills:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   The text mentions "Oral Fluency" as a section in the "RESULTS" chapter, suggesting that the study did investigate speaking skills.
*   The table of contents indicates a "Lexical Fluency Analysis" section, which could be related to speaking skills, as vocabulary knowledge is crucial for effective communication.
*   The study includes pre- and post-tests, allowing for a comparison of oral fluency before and after using Duolingo.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The literature review mentions "Role of Interaction" within the "Sociocultural Theory" section. This is relevant because interaction is a key component of developing speaking skills. The study might explore how Duolingo, which primarily focuses on individual learning, facilitates or hinders opportunities for interaction.
*   The text mentions "Gamification" as a factor in MALL. This is relevant because Duolingo uses gamification to motivate users. The study might analyze how gamification impacts speaking practice and performance.
*   The text mentions "Potential Drawbacks of MALL," including "Unvaried Tasks" and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles." These drawbacks could negatively affect the development of speaking skills if Duolingo's exercises are repetitive and don't provide opportunities for authentic communication.
*   The inclusion of "Duolingo Stories" suggests that the study might consider the impact of these features on language learning, potentially including speaking skills.
*   The study includes a section on "Affective Factors and Attitudes towards MALL." This is relevant because learners' attitudes and motivation can influence their engagement with Duolingo and, consequently, their speaking practice.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The provided text doesn't include specific examples or case studies. However, the mention of "Participants' Language Background and App Use" suggests that the study collected data on individual learners, which could potentially be used for case study analysis.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The provided text doesn't include the study's conclusions. The "RESULTS" chapter and subsequent discussion would contain the conclusions regarding Duolingo's impact on oral fluency.

**Further Research Needed:**

To fully answer the research question, the full dissertation is needed to analyze the methodology, results, and conclusions related to oral fluency. Specifically, the following sections would be crucial:

*   **Methodology:** How was oral fluency measured? What specific tasks were used in the pre- and post-tests?
*   **Results:** What were the specific findings regarding oral fluency? Was there a statistically significant improvement in speaking skills after using Duolingo?
*   **Discussion:** How do the findings relate to existing research on language learning and MALL? What are the limitations of the study? What are the implications for language learners and educators?
*   **Conclusion:** What are the overall conclusions regarding Duolingo's effectiveness on speaking skills?

## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Speaking Skills

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on speaking skills:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   The paper investigates the effects of mobile apps, specifically Duolingo, on language learning outcomes.
*   The "Results" section includes an "Oral Fluency" subsection, indicating that the study directly assesses speaking skills.
*   The study includes "Oral Fluency Pre-test Data in Spanish" and "Oral Fluency Pre/post Comparison," suggesting a measurement of speaking skills before and after Duolingo use.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The paper acknowledges the potential of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) and its integration (or lack thereof) in language learning.
*   The paper mentions company claims of Duolingo being "effective." The study likely aims to evaluate the validity of this claim.
*   The literature review covers Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories, which are relevant for understanding how Duolingo's design might impact speaking skill development.
*   The literature review mentions the "Role of Interaction" in SLA, which is crucial for speaking skills. This suggests the study might consider how Duolingo's interactive features (or lack thereof) affect speaking.
*   The paper mentions "Gamification" as a factor in MALL, which could influence motivation and engagement, indirectly affecting speaking practice.
*   The paper also acknowledges potential drawbacks of MALL, such as "Unvaried Tasks" and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles," which could hinder speaking skill development.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The provided text doesn't include specific examples or case studies. However, the "Methodology" section indicates that the study involves participants and tasks, implying that data was collected from real users.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The provided text doesn't include the final conclusions of the study. The "Results" section is presented, but the overall interpretation and conclusions are not available in this excerpt. The study's conclusion regarding Duolingo's impact on speaking skills would be found in the "Discussion" or "Conclusion" section of the full paper.

# Analysis of Duolingo and HelloTalk Paper for Speaking Skills Research

## 1. Key Findings Related to Duolingo and Speaking Skills

Based on the provided text, the key findings related to Duolingo and speaking skills are:

*   **Poor focus on form in terms of pronunciation:** The abstract mentions that Duolingo was "rarely rated as excellent in any category because of...poor focus on form in terms of pronunciation." This directly relates to speaking skills, as pronunciation is a crucial component.
*   **Interaction:** The table of contents lists "Interaction" as a section in Chapter 5, suggesting that the study investigated how Duolingo facilitates interaction, which is essential for developing speaking skills.
*   **Communicative Language:** The table of contents lists "Communicative Language" as a section in Chapter 5, suggesting that the study investigated how Duolingo promotes communicative language use, which is essential for developing speaking skills.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The study uses established Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo. This provides a theoretical framework for understanding the app's effectiveness in developing various language skills, including speaking.
*   The study uses both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interviews) data to gather user feedback. This mixed-methods approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of user experiences and perceptions of Duolingo's impact on their language skills.
*   The comparison with HelloTalk provides a valuable contrast. HelloTalk's focus on language exchange might offer insights into aspects of speaking practice that Duolingo lacks.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies. However, the appendices mention quotes from users (e.g., "Appendix I: Sarah quote"), which might contain relevant information about their experiences with Duolingo and its impact on their speaking skills.

## 4. Conclusions

*   The abstract indicates that the study discusses the implications of the findings for app developers and users. This suggests that the conclusion will offer recommendations for improving Duolingo's effectiveness in language learning, potentially including specific suggestions for enhancing speaking skills development.
*   The study's conclusion likely addresses the limitations of the research and suggests areas for future investigation. This could include a call for more research specifically focused on Duolingo's impact on speaking skills, using different methodologies or focusing on specific aspects of pronunciation or fluency.
