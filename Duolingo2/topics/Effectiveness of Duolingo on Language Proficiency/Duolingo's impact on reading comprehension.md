## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Reading Comprehension

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on the effectiveness of Duolingo on language proficiency, specifically its impact on reading comprehension:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   The text mentions "Duolingo Stories" (page 27), which directly relates to reading comprehension. This suggests that the study might have investigated the impact of these stories on learners' reading skills.
*   The study investigates overall proficiency (page 91), which could include a reading comprehension component.
*   The literature review likely contains information on Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories relevant to reading comprehension (page 33).
*   The study includes tasks (page 79) that may assess reading comprehension.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The paper frames Duolingo within the context of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) (pages 15-20). This provides a theoretical framework for understanding Duolingo's potential impact.
*   The paper discusses company claims about Duolingo being "effective" and "high quality" (pages 24-26). This is important for critically evaluating the app's actual impact versus its marketing.
*   The literature review (page 33) likely explores SLA theories (e.g., Sociocultural Theory, Zone of Proximal Development) that are relevant to how reading comprehension is developed.
*   The paper acknowledges potential drawbacks of MALL, including "Irrelevance to Classroom Topics" and "Unvaried Tasks" (pages 58-60). These drawbacks could negatively impact reading comprehension development if Duolingo lessons are not aligned with learners' needs or if the reading materials are repetitive.
*   The study mentions previous studies on Duolingo (page 63), which could provide insights into existing research on its effectiveness for reading comprehension.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The text doesn't provide specific examples or case studies related to reading comprehension. However, the mention of "Duolingo Stories" suggests that the study might have used these stories as part of its investigation. The results section (page 84) might contain data related to these stories.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The provided text does not include the conclusions of the study. The conclusions would be found in the later sections of the dissertation, summarizing the findings and their implications for language learning, including reading comprehension.

## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Reading Comprehension

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on language proficiency, specifically reading comprehension:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   The provided text does not contain specific findings related to Duolingo's impact on reading comprehension. The abstract and table of contents suggest a broader investigation into language learning outcomes, including lexical, oral, and written fluency, and overall proficiency.
*   The mention of "Duolingo Stories" (p. 27) is potentially relevant. Duolingo Stories are designed to improve reading and listening comprehension. However, the text doesn't provide any data or analysis on their effectiveness.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **"Effective" (p. 24):** The paper mentions that Duolingo claims to be "effective." This suggests the study might investigate whether these claims hold true. However, without further context, it's unclear if "effective" encompasses reading comprehension specifically.
*   **Literature Review (p. 33):** The literature review likely contains relevant information on Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories and Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), which could provide a theoretical framework for understanding how Duolingo *could* impact reading comprehension.
*   **Potential Drawbacks of MALL (p. 58):** The section on potential drawbacks of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) might highlight limitations that could hinder reading comprehension development, such as "Unvaried Tasks" (p. 60) or "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles" (p. 61).
*   **Previous Studies on Duolingo (p. 63):** This section is crucial. It should summarize existing research on Duolingo, which *might* include studies that touch upon reading comprehension, even if indirectly.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The provided text does not contain specific examples or case studies related to reading comprehension.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Based solely on the provided text, it's impossible to draw any conclusions about Duolingo's impact on reading comprehension. The text sets the stage for an investigation but doesn't present any results or analysis directly related to the subtopic. The study's focus appears to be broader than just reading comprehension.

# Analysis of Duolingo's Impact on Reading Comprehension Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts and analyzes information from Robert Charles Schroeder's 2021 thesis, "DUOLINGO AND HELLOTALK : ANALYZING AND EVALUATING LANGUAGE LEARNING APPLICATIONS USING SLA THEORY AND USER FEEDBACK," focusing specifically on Duolingo's impact on reading comprehension.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Reading Comprehension

The provided abstract and table of contents do not explicitly mention "reading comprehension." However, several aspects of the study touch upon skills related to reading comprehension, such as:

*   **Vocabulary for specific contexts and scenarios:** The abstract mentions that Duolingo was rated well in vocabulary acquisition. A strong vocabulary base is crucial for reading comprehension.
*   **Comprehensible Input and Output:** This section (mentioned in the table of contents) likely explores how well Duolingo provides understandable language input and opportunities for learners to produce language, both of which are relevant to reading comprehension.
*   **Level Appropriateness:** The survey included questions about level appropriateness, which is important for reading comprehension. If the material is too difficult, comprehension will suffer.
*   **Communicative Language:** The study investigates how Duolingo facilitates communicative language skills. While not directly reading comprehension, the ability to understand and use language in context is related.
*   **Noticing:** This section likely explores how Duolingo helps learners notice language features, which can improve reading comprehension.

**Limitations:** Without the full text, it's impossible to pinpoint specific findings directly addressing reading comprehension. The analysis relies on inferring connections based on related concepts.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

Based on the available information, the following analysis and insights can be drawn:

*   **Vocabulary as a Strength:** Duolingo's strength in vocabulary acquisition suggests it could positively impact reading comprehension, as vocabulary knowledge is a foundational element.
*   **Potential Weaknesses:** The "oversimplified grammar instruction" mentioned in the abstract could hinder reading comprehension. A solid understanding of grammar is necessary to parse complex sentences and understand the relationships between ideas in a text.
*   **Level Appropriateness is Key:** The study's focus on level appropriateness highlights the importance of matching reading materials to the learner's current skill level.
*   **Comprehensible Input is Crucial:** The inclusion of "Comprehensible Input and Output" suggests the study examines whether Duolingo provides language that is understandable to learners, which is essential for reading comprehension.

**Overall Impression:** Duolingo likely contributes to reading comprehension through vocabulary building and providing comprehensible input. However, its weaknesses in grammar instruction and potential lack of focus on complex sentence structures might limit its effectiveness in developing advanced reading comprehension skills.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies related to reading comprehension. The appendices are referenced, but the content is not available in the provided text.

## 4. Conclusions

The abstract and table of contents suggest the study concludes with implications for app developers and users. Regarding reading comprehension, the study likely suggests:

*   **For App Developers:** Focus on improving grammar instruction and incorporating more complex sentence structures to enhance reading comprehension skills. Ensure materials are level-appropriate and provide ample comprehensible input.
*   **For App Users:** Recognize Duolingo's strengths in vocabulary and use it as a supplementary tool for reading comprehension. Consider using other resources to develop grammar skills and practice reading more complex texts.

**Overall Conclusion (Based on Limited Information):** While Duolingo may contribute to reading comprehension through vocabulary acquisition and comprehensible input, its limitations in grammar instruction and focus on more complex language structures may necessitate the use of supplementary resources for developing advanced reading comprehension skills. Further analysis of the full text, particularly the sections on "Comprehensible Input and Output," "Level Appropriateness," and "Communicative Language," is needed for a more comprehensive understanding.
