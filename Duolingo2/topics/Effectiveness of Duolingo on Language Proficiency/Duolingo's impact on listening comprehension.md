## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Listening Comprehension

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on Duolingo's effectiveness on language proficiency, specifically listening comprehension:

**1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Listening Comprehension):**

*   The provided text *does not explicitly mention findings related to listening comprehension*. The abstract and table of contents suggest the study focuses on lexical fluency, oral fluency, written fluency, and overall proficiency. There's no direct indication of a specific listening comprehension assessment.

**2. Analysis and Insights:**

*   **MALL & SLA:** The paper explores Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) and its connection to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories. This is relevant because effective listening comprehension development should align with established SLA principles. The paper discusses potential drawbacks of MALL, including a lack of adherence to SLA principles, which could impact listening comprehension if Duolingo doesn't adequately address these principles.
*   **Gamification:** The paper mentions gamification as a feature of MALL. While not directly about listening, gamified elements in Duolingo *could* indirectly influence listening comprehension by increasing motivation and engagement, leading to more practice.
*   **Duolingo Stories:** The paper mentions "Duolingo Stories." These stories *could* be a source of listening practice within the app, but the text doesn't provide any analysis of their effectiveness.
*   **Time on Task:** The paper mentions "Additional Time on Task" as a factor in MALL. If Duolingo encourages more time spent learning, this *could* translate to more listening practice, even if the app doesn't explicitly focus on it.

**3. Examples or Case Studies:**

*   The provided text *does not include specific examples or case studies* related to listening comprehension or any other skill. The study itself likely contains such data, but it's not present in this excerpt.

**4. Conclusions:**

*   Based on the provided text, *no conclusions can be drawn about Duolingo's impact on listening comprehension*. The excerpt focuses on the broader context of MALL, SLA, and Duolingo's features, but lacks specific findings related to the subtopic. The study's results, when available, would be necessary to draw any conclusions.

**In summary, while the provided text offers a good overview of the theoretical background and context for studying Duolingo's effectiveness, it doesn't contain any specific information or findings directly related to listening comprehension. Further sections of the paper (Results, Discussion, Conclusion) would need to be analyzed to determine Duolingo's impact on this skill.**

## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Impact on Listening Comprehension

Based on the provided text, here's an extraction of relevant information for a research project focusing on the effectiveness of Duolingo on language proficiency, specifically its impact on listening comprehension:

**1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Listening Comprehension):**

*   The provided text does not explicitly mention findings related to listening comprehension. The abstract and table of contents suggest the study focuses on lexical, oral, and written fluency, and overall proficiency. There is no direct mention of listening comprehension as a measured outcome.

**2. Analysis and Insights:**

*   **MALL Context:** The paper frames Duolingo within the broader context of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL), highlighting its potential and existing research.
*   **Company Claims:** The paper critically examines Duolingo's claims of being "free," "fun," "effective," and "high quality." This suggests a rigorous evaluation of the app's actual performance against its marketing promises.
*   **SLA Theory:** The literature review connects CALL and MALL to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories, including behaviorism and sociocultural theory (specifically, the Zone of Proximal Development and the role of interaction). This theoretical grounding is crucial for understanding how Duolingo might (or might not) facilitate language learning.
*   **Potential Drawbacks:** The paper acknowledges potential drawbacks of MALL, such as logistical factors, irrelevance to classroom topics, unvaried tasks, and a lack of adherence to SLA principles. These drawbacks could indirectly affect listening comprehension if, for example, the tasks are repetitive and don't provide sufficient exposure to varied authentic audio input.
*   **Previous Studies:** The paper references previous studies on Duolingo and LearnSmart. These studies, although not detailed in this excerpt, likely provide a baseline for understanding the existing research landscape and identifying gaps that the current study aims to address.

**3. Examples or Case Studies:**

*   The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies.

**4. Conclusions:**

*   The provided text does not include the study's conclusions. The results and discussion sections, which are not included in this excerpt, would contain the conclusions regarding Duolingo's effectiveness.

**Implications for Research on Listening Comprehension:**

While the provided text doesn't directly address listening comprehension, it offers several avenues for further investigation:

*   **Indirect Impact:** The study's findings on lexical and oral fluency could have implications for listening comprehension. For example, improved lexical fluency might enable learners to recognize more words in spoken language, thereby enhancing comprehension. Similarly, improved oral fluency might correlate with better comprehension skills.
*   **Task Analysis:** A detailed analysis of Duolingo's tasks is needed to determine the extent to which they target listening comprehension skills. Are there specific exercises that focus on auditory discrimination, understanding spoken instructions, or comprehending dialogues?
*   **SLA Principles:** The paper's emphasis on SLA principles suggests that the effectiveness of Duolingo for listening comprehension depends on how well it aligns with these principles. Does the app provide opportunities for meaningful interaction, exposure to authentic language, and feedback on listening performance?
*   **Future Research:** The study's findings could inform future research specifically designed to investigate Duolingo's impact on listening comprehension. This could involve using pre- and post-tests of listening comprehension skills, analyzing learner performance on Duolingo's listening exercises, and conducting qualitative interviews to gather learner perspectives.

# Analysis of Duolingo's Impact on Listening Comprehension Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document analyzes the provided text from Schroeder's (2021) thesis, focusing on Duolingo's impact on listening comprehension, a subtopic within the broader topic of Duolingo's effectiveness on language proficiency.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Listening Comprehension

The provided text does not explicitly isolate "listening comprehension" as a distinct category. However, several findings are relevant and can be inferred:

*   **Focus on Form (Pronunciation):** The abstract mentions "poor focus on form in terms of pronunciation." While not directly listening comprehension, pronunciation is intrinsically linked. Poor pronunciation instruction likely hinders a learner's ability to accurately decode spoken language.
*   **Comprehensible Input and Output:** The survey included questions on "Level Appropriateness & Comprehensible Input and Output." If Duolingo fails to provide comprehensible *aural* input, listening comprehension will suffer.
*   **Interaction and Communicative Language:** The survey also explored "Interaction" and "Communicative Language." If Duolingo lacks opportunities for interactive listening practice (e.g., responding to spoken prompts, participating in simulated conversations), it will likely be less effective for developing listening skills.
*   **Noticing:** The survey included a section on "Noticing." If Duolingo does not facilitate learners' ability to notice features of the spoken language, listening comprehension will be negatively impacted.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Vocabulary Focus:** The abstract highlights Duolingo's strength in "vocabulary for specific contexts and scenarios." While vocabulary is crucial for listening comprehension, it's not the only factor. Learners might recognize words but struggle with connected speech, accents, or rapid delivery.
*   **Oversimplified Grammar:** The abstract notes "oversimplified grammar instruction." A solid understanding of grammar is essential for parsing complex sentences in spoken language. Oversimplification could hinder learners' ability to understand nuanced or grammatically complex spoken input.
*   **User Frustration:** The abstract mentions "some aspects of the app that lead to user frustration." Frustration can negatively impact motivation and engagement, indirectly affecting all language skills, including listening.
*   **SLA Principles:** The study uses SLA (Second Language Acquisition) principles to evaluate the apps. This suggests that the analysis considers factors like input, interaction, and output, which are all relevant to listening comprehension.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

The provided text does not include specific examples or case studies related to listening comprehension. The appendices are referenced, but the full text is not available to determine if they contain relevant examples.

## 4. Conclusions

Based on the provided text, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding Duolingo's impact on listening comprehension:

*   **Potential Weaknesses:** Duolingo's weaknesses in pronunciation instruction, grammar simplification, and lack of interactive practice may hinder the development of listening comprehension skills.
*   **Vocabulary Strength:** While Duolingo's vocabulary focus is a positive aspect, it's insufficient for developing comprehensive listening skills.
*   **Need for Further Investigation:** The study suggests a need for further investigation into how Duolingo addresses the specific challenges of listening comprehension, such as dealing with connected speech, accents, and varying speaking speeds.
*   **Importance of SLA Principles:** The study's use of SLA principles highlights the importance of considering factors like comprehensible input, interaction, and noticing when evaluating the effectiveness of language learning apps for listening comprehension.
