## Analysis of Duolingo's Limitations in Advanced Language Learning Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts relevant information from Robert Charles Schroeder's (2021) thesis, "DUOLINGO AND HELLOTALK : ANALYZING AND EVALUATING LANGUAGE LEARNING APPLICATIONS USING SLA THEORY AND USER FEEDBACK," focusing on Duolingo's limitations in advanced language learning.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Oversimplified Grammar Instruction:** Users generally rated Duolingo well, but it was rarely rated as excellent in any category due to oversimplified grammar instruction. This suggests a limitation in supporting advanced learners who require more nuanced and in-depth grammatical explanations.
*   **Poor Focus on Form (Pronunciation):** The study found a weakness in Duolingo's focus on form, particularly in pronunciation. This is a crucial aspect of language learning, especially at advanced levels where accuracy and fluency are paramount.
*   **Vocabulary Focus:** While Duolingo was strong in vocabulary for specific contexts and scenarios, this strength might not translate to advanced language proficiency, which requires a broader and more sophisticated vocabulary.
*   **User Frustration:** Some aspects of the app led to user frustration, which could hinder motivation and engagement, particularly for advanced learners who might find the app repetitive or lacking in challenge.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **SLA Principles:** The study uses established Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo. This provides a theoretical framework for understanding the app's strengths and weaknesses in facilitating language learning.
*   **User Feedback:** The study incorporates user feedback through surveys and interviews, offering valuable insights into learners' experiences with Duolingo. This helps to identify specific areas where the app falls short in meeting the needs of advanced learners.
*   **Comparison with HelloTalk:** The comparison with HelloTalk highlights the importance of interaction and communicative language practice, which are areas where Duolingo may be lacking. HelloTalk's success was tied to finding reliable language exchange partners, suggesting that advanced learners benefit from real-world communication opportunities.
*   **Level Appropriateness:** The study directly addresses the issue of level appropriateness, indicating that Duolingo may not adequately cater to the needs of advanced learners who require more challenging and complex content.
*   **Comprehensible Input and Output:** While not explicitly stated in the abstract, the mention of "Comprehensible Input and Output" in the contents suggests that the study explores how well Duolingo provides learners with understandable language input and opportunities to practice output, both of which are crucial for language acquisition at all levels, including advanced.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The abstract doesn't provide specific examples or case studies. However, the mention of surveys and interviews suggests that the full paper likely includes qualitative data that illustrates the experiences of Duolingo users, including those who may have found the app inadequate for advanced learning. The appendices also suggest that there are responses from users that could be used as examples.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The study concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for app developers and app users. This suggests that the authors offer recommendations for improving Duolingo's effectiveness, particularly in addressing the limitations identified in the study.
*   The study implies that Duolingo, while useful for beginners, may not be sufficient for advanced language learners due to its oversimplified grammar, poor pronunciation focus, and lack of opportunities for meaningful interaction and communicative practice.

## Analysis of Duolingo's Limitations in Advanced Language Learning Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts relevant information from Schroeder's (2021) thesis, "Duolingo and HelloTalk: Analyzing and Evaluating Language Learning Applications Using SLA Theory and User Feedback," focusing specifically on Duolingo's limitations in advanced language learning.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Oversimplified Grammar Instruction:** Users generally rated Duolingo well, but it was rarely rated as excellent in any category due to oversimplified grammar instruction. This suggests a limitation in handling complex grammatical structures necessary for advanced language proficiency.
*   **Poor Focus on Form (Pronunciation):** The study found a poor focus on form, particularly in pronunciation. This is a significant limitation for advanced learners who need to refine their pronunciation for effective communication.
*   **Vocabulary Focus:** While Duolingo was strong in vocabulary for specific contexts, this strength might not translate to advanced language use, which requires a broader and more nuanced vocabulary.
*   **User Frustration:** Some aspects of the app led to user frustration, which could hinder motivation and continued use, especially for advanced learners seeking more challenging and rewarding experiences.
*   **Level Appropriateness:** The study investigated level appropriateness, suggesting that Duolingo's effectiveness might diminish as learners progress to higher levels.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **SLA Principles:** The study uses Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo. This framework highlights the importance of factors like comprehensible input, output, interaction, and focus on form, which are crucial for advanced language learning. Duolingo's shortcomings in these areas suggest limitations in its ability to facilitate advanced language acquisition.
*   **User Feedback:** The study incorporates user feedback through surveys and interviews. This provides valuable insights into the perceived strengths and weaknesses of Duolingo from the learner's perspective. The negative feedback regarding grammar, pronunciation, and frustration points to specific areas where Duolingo falls short for advanced learners.
*   **Comparison with HelloTalk:** The comparison with HelloTalk is insightful. HelloTalk's reliance on interaction with native speakers might offer a more suitable environment for advanced learners seeking authentic communication and personalized feedback, areas where Duolingo struggles.
*   **Motivation and Gamification:** While Duolingo uses gamification to motivate users, the study suggests that this might not be sufficient for advanced learners who require more intrinsic motivation derived from genuine progress and meaningful communication.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The abstract mentions surveys and interviews were conducted, but the specific examples or case studies from those are not included in this excerpt. The full thesis would likely contain specific user quotes or scenarios illustrating these limitations.
*   Appendices B, D, F, and H contain responses to specific questions about Duolingo and HelloTalk, which could provide further examples of user experiences related to the limitations of Duolingo.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The study concludes by discussing implications for app developers and users. This suggests that Duolingo developers should address the identified limitations to better cater to advanced learners.
*   The study implies that advanced learners might need to supplement Duolingo with other resources or platforms that offer more comprehensive grammar instruction, pronunciation practice, and opportunities for authentic communication.
*   The abstract mentions that the findings have implications for app users. This suggests that advanced learners should be aware of Duolingo's limitations and consider alternative or supplementary resources to achieve their language learning goals.

## Analysis of "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO" for Research on Duolingo's Limitations in Advanced Language Learning

Based on the provided text (limited to the table of contents and first few pages), here's an extraction of relevant information:

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Duolingo's Limitations in Advanced Language Learning)

*   **Potential Drawbacks of MALL (Mobile-Assisted Language Learning):** The table of contents lists "Potential Drawbacks of MALL" as a section (page 58), which includes sub-sections like "Irrelevance to Classroom Topics," "Unvaried Tasks," and "Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles." These points directly relate to limitations, especially concerning advanced learning.
*   **Lack of Adherence to SLA Principles:** This is a critical point. If Duolingo doesn't adhere to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles, it will likely be ineffective for advanced learners who require more nuanced and sophisticated learning approaches.
*   **Unvaried Tasks:** This suggests a potential limitation in providing the complexity and variety needed for advanced language acquisition. Advanced learners need exposure to diverse language contexts and tasks.
*   **Learning Outcomes and the Focus on Vocabulary Acquisition:** The table of contents mentions a section on "Learning Outcomes and the Focus on Vocabulary Acquisition" (page 50). While vocabulary is important, advanced language learning requires more than just vocabulary; it involves complex grammar, idiomatic expressions, cultural understanding, and the ability to use the language in sophisticated ways. If Duolingo primarily focuses on vocabulary, it will likely fall short for advanced learners.
*   **Previous Studies on Duolingo:** The inclusion of a section on "Previous Studies on Duolingo" (page 63) suggests that the paper will review existing research, which may highlight limitations identified by other researchers.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **MALL and SLA:** The paper connects MALL (including Duolingo) to SLA theory. This is crucial because it provides a theoretical framework for evaluating Duolingo's effectiveness. If Duolingo doesn't align with established SLA principles, its limitations for advanced learners are likely significant.
*   **Company Claims vs. Reality:** The paper examines Duolingo's claims of being "Free," "Fun," "Effective," and "High quality." This suggests a critical analysis of whether Duolingo lives up to its promises, which could reveal limitations, especially for advanced learners who require more than just basic, gamified instruction.
*   **The Importance of Interaction:** The mention of "Role of Interaction" within the Sociocultural Theory section (page 43) is relevant. Advanced language learning often requires significant interaction with native speakers or other advanced learners. If Duolingo lacks opportunities for meaningful interaction, it will likely be insufficient for advanced learners.
*   **CALL and MALL:** The paper differentiates between Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL). This distinction is important because MALL, while offering convenience, may also have limitations compared to more comprehensive CALL approaches.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The provided text doesn't contain specific examples or case studies. However, the mention of "Previous Studies on Duolingo" suggests that the paper will likely include examples or findings from other research that might illustrate Duolingo's limitations.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Based on the table of contents and introductory sections, the paper is likely to conclude that while Duolingo may be useful for beginners, its limitations in areas such as adherence to SLA principles, task variety, and opportunities for interaction make it less effective for advanced language learners. The paper will likely highlight the need for more comprehensive and nuanced approaches to language learning at higher levels of proficiency.
