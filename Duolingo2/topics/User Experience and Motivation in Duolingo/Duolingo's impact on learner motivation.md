# Analysis of Duolingo's Impact on Learner Motivation Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts relevant information from Schroeder's (2021) thesis, "DUOLINGO AND HELLOTALK : ANALYZING AND EVALUATING LANGUAGE LEARNING APPLICATIONS USING SLA THEORY AND USER FEEDBACK," focusing on Duolingo's impact on learner motivation.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Learner Motivation

*   **General Positive Rating:** Users generally rated Duolingo well in most capacities.
*   **Motivation and Gamification:** The survey specifically addressed motivation and gamification aspects of Duolingo.
*   **Vocabulary Strength:** Duolingo was considered strong in vocabulary acquisition for specific contexts and scenarios.
*   **Not Excellent Rating:** The app was rarely rated as excellent in any category.
*   **User Frustration:** Some aspects of the app led to user frustration.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The study used established Second Language Acquisition (SLA) principles to evaluate Duolingo.
*   User feedback was gathered through surveys and interviews, providing both quantitative and qualitative data.
*   The inclusion of "Motivation and Gamification" as a specific survey category highlights its importance in the study's evaluation of Duolingo.
*   The finding that Duolingo was rarely rated as "excellent" suggests areas for improvement, even though it was generally well-received.
*   The mention of user frustration indicates potential demotivating factors within the app's design or functionality.
*   The study compares Duolingo to HelloTalk, providing a comparative perspective on user experience and motivation.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The abstract mentions surveys and interviews were conducted, implying that specific user experiences and opinions were collected. However, the abstract does not provide specific examples or case studies.
*   The appendices include responses to survey questions, which may contain specific examples of user experiences related to motivation (e.g., Appendix B: Duolingo Question 16 responses, Appendix D: Duolingo question 23 responses). These appendices were not included in the provided text.

## 4. Conclusions

*   The study concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for app developers and app users.
*   The findings suggest that while Duolingo has strengths, particularly in vocabulary and potentially in motivation through gamification, there are areas where it could be improved to enhance the user experience and reduce frustration.
*   The comparison with HelloTalk provides a benchmark for Duolingo's performance and highlights the importance of factors like reliable language exchange partners in user satisfaction.

# Analysis of Duolingo's Impact on Learner Motivation Based on Schroeder (2021)

This document extracts and analyzes information from Schroeder's (2021) thesis, "DUOLINGO AND HELLOTALK : ANALYZING AND EVALUATING LANGUAGE LEARNING APPLICATIONS USING SLA THEORY AND USER FEEDBACK," focusing on Duolingo's impact on learner motivation.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Motivation

*   **General Positive Rating:** Users generally rated Duolingo well across most capacities.
*   **Gamification and Motivation:** The study specifically investigated "Motivation and Gamification" as a factor influencing user experience.
*   **Frustration Factors:** While generally positive, the study also found that some aspects of Duolingo lead to user frustration, which could negatively impact motivation.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Vocabulary Strength:** Duolingo's strength lies in vocabulary acquisition for specific contexts and scenarios. This suggests that users may be motivated by the practical application of the language they are learning.
*   **Grammar Weakness:** Oversimplified grammar instruction and poor focus on pronunciation were identified as weaknesses. This could lead to demotivation if learners feel they are not developing a comprehensive understanding of the language.
*   **Gamification's Role:** The study acknowledges the role of gamification in Duolingo and its potential impact on motivation. However, the abstract does not provide specific details on how gamification affects motivation, only that it was investigated.
*   **User Feedback Importance:** The study emphasizes the importance of user feedback in evaluating language learning apps. This suggests that understanding user perceptions of motivation is crucial for app developers.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The abstract does not provide specific examples or case studies related to Duolingo and motivation. The appendices might contain relevant information from survey responses and interviews, but they are not included in the provided text.

## 4. Conclusions

*   Duolingo is generally well-received by users, particularly for vocabulary acquisition.
*   Weaknesses in grammar instruction and pronunciation may lead to user frustration.
*   The study highlights the importance of considering both positive and negative aspects of Duolingo's design when evaluating its impact on learner motivation.
*   The findings have implications for app developers, suggesting areas for improvement to enhance user experience and maintain motivation.

Okay, here's the extracted and formatted information from the provided text, focusing on User Experience and Motivation in Duolingo, specifically its impact on learner motivation:

# User Experience and Motivation in Duolingo: Analysis of Lori Lye's Dissertation

This document analyzes the provided text from Lori Lye's dissertation, "INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MOBILE APPS ON LANGUAGE LEARNING OUTCOMES: A STUDY ON DUOLINGO," focusing on aspects relevant to user experience and learner motivation within the Duolingo application.

## 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic (Learner Motivation)

*   **"Fun" as a Company Claim:** The dissertation highlights Duolingo's marketing claim of being "fun" as a key element of its user experience. This directly relates to motivation, as perceived enjoyment is a significant driver for continued engagement.
*   **Gamification:** The dissertation mentions gamification as a factor in MALL (Mobile-Assisted Language Learning), which is a core component of Duolingo's design. Gamification is often used to increase motivation and engagement.
*   **Affective Factors and Attitudes towards MALL:** The dissertation acknowledges the importance of affective factors (emotions, attitudes) in MALL. Positive attitudes towards the app are likely to correlate with higher motivation.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Company Claims Analysis:** The dissertation critically examines Duolingo's claims, including "fun," "effective," and "high quality." This suggests an investigation into whether the app lives up to its promises in terms of user experience and learning outcomes, which directly impacts motivation. If users perceive the app as not being fun or effective, their motivation will likely decrease.
*   **MALL and Motivation:** The dissertation places Duolingo within the context of MALL. The discussion of MALL's potential drawbacks, such as "unvaried tasks," is relevant to motivation. Repetitive tasks can lead to boredom and decreased motivation.
*   **Individual Differences:** The dissertation acknowledges that individual differences play a role in language learning. This suggests that Duolingo's impact on motivation may vary depending on the learner's personality, learning style, and prior experience.
*   **Additional Time on Task:** The dissertation mentions "Additional Time on Task" as a factor in MALL. This is relevant to motivation because if Duolingo motivates learners to spend more time learning, it is effectively increasing their engagement.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The text does not contain specific examples or case studies related to Duolingo's impact on learner motivation.

## 4. Conclusions

Based on the provided text, the dissertation aims to investigate the effectiveness of Duolingo as a language learning tool. While the text doesn't offer definitive conclusions, it sets the stage for an analysis of how Duolingo's features, particularly its claims of being "fun" and its use of gamification, influence learner motivation. The dissertation also acknowledges the importance of affective factors and individual differences in determining the app's impact on motivation. The potential drawbacks of MALL, such as unvaried tasks, are also considered as factors that could negatively affect motivation.
