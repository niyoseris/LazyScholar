# FDA Aspartame Pregnancy

**Regulatory Guidelines and Recommendations Regarding Aspartame Use in Pregnancy: FDA Aspartame Pregnancy**

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established guidelines regarding the use of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy. Specifically, the FDA considers aspartame safe for consumption during pregnancy and lactation (Uncited FDA Source). However, moderation in aspartame consumption is generally recommended (Uncited FDA Source). It is crucial to note that aspartame should be avoided by pregnant women with elevated levels of phenylalanine in their blood (Uncited FDA Source). Similarly, the FDA has deemed sucralose (Splenda) safe for consumption by all individuals, including pregnant women (Uncited FDA Source).
