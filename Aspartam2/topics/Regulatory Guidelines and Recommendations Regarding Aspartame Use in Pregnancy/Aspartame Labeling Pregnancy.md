Okay, I will analyze the provided filename and attempt to extract the citation information and format it in APA style.
**Analysis of Filename: Safe-Supplements-and-OTC-Meds-in-Pregnancy-2-2-23-1.pdf**
Based on the filename, here's a possible APA-style citation:
*   **Author(s):** (Not available from the filename, needs to be inferred from content)
*   **Year:** 2023
*   **Title:** Safe Supplements and OTC Meds in Pregnancy
*   **Journal/Publisher:** (Not available from the filename, needs to be inferred from content)
**Formatted APA Citation (with placeholders for missing information):**
[Author Last Name, Author Initial(s).] (2023). *Safe supplements and OTC meds in pregnancy*. [Journal/Publisher Information].
**Important Considerations:**
*   **Author(s):** The most crucial missing piece.  I would need to open the PDF to find the author(s). It could be an individual author, a group of authors, or a corporate author (e.g., "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists").
*   **Journal/Publisher:**  This is also critical. The PDF itself would need to be examined to determine if it's a journal article, a report from a specific organization, a guideline, etc.  The source will dictate the correct APA formatting.
*   **Page Numbers/DOI:** If the PDF is a journal article, I would also need to find the page numbers and DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for a complete citation.
**Example of a possible complete citation (if the PDF was a guideline from ACOG):**
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. (2023). *Safe supplements and OTC meds in pregnancy*. ACOG.
**Disclaimer:**  Without the actual PDF content, I can only provide a *potential* citation based on the filename. The actual citation could be significantly different.
