# Diet Soda Pregnancy

### Diet Soda Consumption During Pregnancy

Given the prevalence of diet soda consumption, pregnant individuals should exercise caution due to the presence of both caffeine and artificial sweeteners (Li et al., 2023). While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers aspartame (NutraSweet or Equal) safe for consumption during pregnancy and lactation, moderation is advised (Li et al., 2023). Conversely, the use of saccharin by pregnant women remains controversial due to its ability to cross the placenta and potentially persist in fetal tissue (Li et al., 2023). Sukraloz (Splenda), however, is considered safe for all populations, including pregnant women, according to the FDA (Li et al., 2023). Therefore, consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended to determine appropriate intake levels and the specific types of artificial sweeteners deemed suitable during pregnancy (Li et al., 2023).
