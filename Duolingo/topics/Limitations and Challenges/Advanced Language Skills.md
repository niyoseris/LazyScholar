# Limitations and Challenges: Advanced Language Skills

## 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Importance of Oral Language:** The document emphasizes the critical role of advanced oral language skills for multilingual learners to achieve academic success. It highlights that the ability to speak at length, support viewpoints with relevant details, and communicate effectively across disciplines is essential.
*   **WIDA Framework:** The WIDA Standards Framework, including the Features of Academic Language and Performance Definitions, provides a structured approach to understanding and assessing the development of oral language skills.
*   **Dimensions of Language:** The document identifies three key dimensions of academic language: discourse, sentence, and word/phrase. Development in each dimension contributes to advanced language skills.
*   **Progression of Skills:** The document outlines how oral language skills develop over time, from basic phrases and sentences at lower proficiency levels to complex sentences and technical vocabulary at higher levels.
*   **Speaking Rubric:** The Speaking Rubric of the WIDA Consortium provides specific levels of expectations for students' ability to express themselves and communicate in content areas, outlining key linguistic skills necessary for success.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Defining "Advanced":** The document implicitly defines "advanced language skills" as the ability to use sustained, connected oral language with confidence, coherence, and precision, tailored to the purpose, situation, and audience. It also includes the ability to use a full range of sentence patterns and grammatical structures, and precise vocabulary.
*   **Challenges in Development:** Developing advanced oral language skills is presented as a challenge that requires understanding the specific linguistic features needed for academic success.
*   **Focus on Productive Language:** The document specifically focuses on productive language, the language a student uses to express thoughts and ideas, and more specifically oral language.
*   **Importance of Context:** The document emphasizes the importance of context in language development, noting that language skills should be matched to content area topics.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Level 2 vs. Level 4:** The document provides a comparison of language skills at Level 2 (Emerging) and Level 4 (Expanding) within the WIDA framework. This illustrates the progression from short, repetitive sentences with general vocabulary to more complex sentences with specific and technical content-area language.
    *   **Level 2:** Phrases or short sentences, formulaic grammatical structures, general content words.
    *   **Level 4:** Short, expanded, and some complex sentences, compound and complex grammatical structures, specific and some technical content-area language.
*   **Examples of Linguistic Skills:** The document provides examples of linguistic skills that develop as students build language skills, such as speaking more fluently, using more technical vocabulary, and organizing speech more effectively.
    *   Using "save time" instead of vague vocabulary.
    *   Producing a broader variety of grammatical structures.

## 4. Conclusions

*   **Oral Language is Key:** The document concludes that oral language skills are essential for multilingual learners to succeed in the classroom.
*   **WIDA Framework as a Tool:** The WIDA Standards Framework provides valuable tools for understanding and assessing the development of oral language skills.
*   **Progression and Nuance:** The development of advanced oral language skills is a gradual process that requires attention to the dimensions of language and the specific linguistic features needed for academic success.
*   **Speaking Rubric as a Guide:** The Speaking Rubric of the WIDA Consortium outlines key linguistic skills necessary for success in a school context.
