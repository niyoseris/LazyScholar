# Duolingo's Design and Features: Course Structure (Analysis of Washburn University IEP)

This analysis extracts information relevant to Duolingo's course structure from the provided text, despite the text describing Washburn University's Intensive English Program (IEP) and not Duolingo. The analysis focuses on how the IEP is structured, which can provide insights into general principles of language course design.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Course Structure

*   **Leveled Structure:** The IEP utilizes a three-level structure for each skill area: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.
*   **Skill-Based Courses:** Courses are divided into four key skill areas: Reading, Speaking/Understanding, Writing, and Language in Context.
*   **Course Duration and Frequency:** Classes follow the university schedule, meeting four times per week each semester (16 weeks). Some courses meet 2-3 hours per week, and some may be offered during a 5-week summer session.
*   **Progression Requirements:** Students need to earn a C (70%) or better in each 200-level course or achieve specific scores on standardized tests (TOEFL, IELTS, or IEP Placement Test) to complete the IEP and fulfill English proficiency requirements. Passing to the next level also requires a C or better or appropriate test scores.
*   **Credit Earning:** IE202, 203, and 204 are General Education courses applicable to Humanities requirements. IE102, 103, and 104 satisfy elective credits.
*   **Course Descriptions:** Each course level within each skill area has specific learning objectives and focuses on different aspects of language acquisition. For example, IE072 focuses on the 1000 most common English words, while IE202 focuses on academic vocabulary and reading fluency.
*   **Language in Context Seminar:** This course provides opportunities to experience language in local cultural contexts through field trips and guest speakers.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Comprehensive Skill Coverage:** The IEP's structure emphasizes a balanced approach to language learning by addressing reading, speaking, writing, and contextual understanding. This holistic approach is crucial for developing well-rounded language proficiency.
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** The three-level structure allows for a gradual increase in difficulty, ensuring that students build a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced concepts.
*   **Alignment with Academic Goals:** The IEP is designed to prepare students for success in university degree programs, with courses that contribute to general education and elective credits.
*   **Integration of Assessment:** The use of grades and standardized tests provides a mechanism for assessing student progress and ensuring that they meet the required proficiency levels.
*   **Contextual Learning:** The Language in Context Seminar highlights the importance of cultural understanding and practical application of language skills.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Course Examples:**
    *   **IE 072 (Reading):** Focuses on foundational vocabulary and reading strategies.
    *   **IE 203 (Speaking):** Emphasizes presentation skills and American communication styles.
    *   **IE 204 (Writing):** Develops essay-writing skills on diverse academic topics.
*   **Student Progression:** A student might start in IE072, IE073, and IE074, progress to IE102, IE103, and IE104, and finally complete IE202, IE203, and IE204.

## 4. Conclusions

While the text describes Washburn University's IEP, it offers valuable insights into language course design. The IEP's structure, with its leveled approach, skill-based courses, and integration of assessment, provides a framework for creating effective language learning programs. The emphasis on academic goals and contextual learning further enhances the program's relevance and effectiveness. These principles can be applied to the design of other language learning platforms, including Duolingo, to improve the user experience and learning outcomes.
