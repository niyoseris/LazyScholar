# Learner Characteristics and Usage Patterns: Completion Rates

## 1. Key Findings Related to Completion Rates

This document presents completion rates for various academic programs across different colleges and the graduate school. The data includes:

*   **Program Level:** Certificates, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate.
*   **Completion Rate Metrics:** 100%, 150%, and 200% completion rates for specific cohorts (AY23, AY21, AY20, AY19, AY17, AY15).
*   **Time-to-Completion:** Average time-to-completion for graduates in AY24.
*   **Number of Graduates:** Number of graduates in AY24.

**Specific findings related to completion rates:**

*   **Variability Across Programs:** Completion rates vary significantly across different programs and degree levels. Some programs have very high completion rates (e.g., Dental Hygiene BS, Genetic Counseling MS, HSIE-CERT), while others have considerably lower rates (e.g., Public Health MPH, Nursing Science PhD, Epidemiology PhD).
*   **Impact of Time Extension:** Completion rates generally increase when considering 150% and 200% of the standard program time, indicating that some students require additional time to complete their degrees.
*   **Differences Across Cohorts:** Completion rates are tracked for different academic year cohorts (e.g., AY23, AY21, AY20, AY19, AY17, AY15), allowing for some comparison of trends over time, although direct comparisons are limited without further context.
*   **Certificate Programs:** Certificate programs generally show high completion rates, especially at 100% of the standard time.
*   **Doctoral Programs:** Doctoral programs tend to have lower completion rates, particularly at 100% of the standard time, suggesting that these programs often require more than the standard time for completion.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Program Rigor and Student Support:** The variability in completion rates may reflect differences in program rigor, student support services, and the characteristics of students enrolled in each program. Programs with lower completion rates may benefit from a review of their curriculum, advising services, and student support systems.
*   **Time Management and Student Challenges:** The increase in completion rates at 150% and 200% suggests that many students face challenges in completing their programs within the standard timeframe. These challenges could include financial constraints, personal issues, or academic difficulties.
*   **Cohort Effects:** Differences in completion rates across cohorts could be due to changes in admission standards, curriculum revisions, or external factors such as economic conditions.
*   **Program Type:** Certificate programs, often shorter and more focused, tend to have higher completion rates than longer degree programs like doctorates. This is likely due to the shorter time commitment and the specific goals of students pursuing certificates.
*   **BSN Programs:** Nursing BSN programs show relatively high completion rates, especially at 150% and 200% completion.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Dental Hygiene BS (DH-BS):** Consistently high completion rates (93.9% at 100%, 150%, and 200% of standard time) suggest a well-structured program with effective student support.
*   **Public Health MPH (PH-MPH):** Low 100% completion rate (3.2%) with a significant increase at 200% (64.5%) indicates that many students in this program require more than the standard time to complete their degree. This could be due to the program's demands, student workload, or other factors.
*   **Nursing Science PhD (NS-PHD):** Consistently low completion rates across all timeframes (0.0% at 100%, 25.0% at 150% and 200%) suggest potential issues with program structure, student support, or student preparedness.
*   **Respiratory Care AS-to-BS (CRCRRT-BS):** Completion rates of 60%, 60%, and 80% at 100%, 150%, and 200% respectively, indicate a need to investigate factors hindering timely completion.

## 4. Conclusions

The data provides a valuable overview of completion rates across various academic programs. The significant variability in completion rates highlights the need for further investigation into the factors that contribute to student success and challenges. Colleges and departments should analyze their program-specific data to identify areas for improvement, such as curriculum design, student support services, and advising practices. Further research could explore the reasons behind the differences in completion rates across programs and cohorts, as well as the impact of student characteristics and institutional resources on student success.

*   **Program Name and Degree Level:** Identifies the specific program and whether it's a BS, MS, CERT, PhD, etc.
*   **Standard Time to Degree:** Shows the expected duration of the program.
*   **Number of Graduates (AY24):** Indicates the number of students who graduated in Academic Year 2024.
*   **Average Time-to-Completion (AY24 Graduates):** Shows the average time it took AY24 graduates to complete the program.
*   **AYXX Cohort:** Refers to the academic year the cohort of students started the program.
*   **100% Completion Rates:** Percentage of the AYXX cohort completing the program within the standard time.
*   **150% Completion Rates:** Percentage of the AYXX cohort completing the program within 1.5 times the standard time.
*   **200% Completion Rates:** Percentage of the AYXX cohort completing the program within 2 times the standard time.

**Specific findings related to completion rates:**

*   Completion rates vary significantly across programs and colleges.
*   Certificate programs tend to have high completion rates at 100% of the standard time, but some have 0%.
*   Bachelor's degrees generally have higher completion rates than Master's or Doctoral degrees.
*   Professional programs like Medicine (MD) and Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) show high completion rates.
*   PhD programs often have lower 100% completion rates, with significant increases at 150% and 200% of the standard time.
*   Some programs show 0% completion rates at 100% of the standard time, indicating potential issues with program structure or student support.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Program Type and Completion:** The type of program (certificate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral) appears to be a strong predictor of completion rates. Certificate programs are often shorter and more focused, leading to higher on-time completion. Doctoral programs, being longer and more research-intensive, naturally have lower on-time completion rates.
*   **Time-to-Completion vs. Completion Rates:** The average time-to-completion is a useful metric, but it doesn't fully capture the completion picture. Examining completion rates at 100%, 150%, and 200% provides a more nuanced understanding of how students progress through different programs.
*   **Cohort Effects:** Comparing completion rates across different cohorts (AY15, AY17, AY19, AY20, AY21, AY23) could reveal trends or changes in program effectiveness over time. However, the data provided is limited to one cohort per program.
*   **Potential Issues:** Programs with consistently low completion rates (e.g., some PhD programs, certain Master's programs) may require further investigation to identify and address potential barriers to student success. These barriers could include funding issues, advising problems, or program structure issues.
*   **Program Rigor:** The data suggests that programs with higher rigor and longer duration (e.g., PhD programs) tend to have lower completion rates within the standard time frame. This is expected, as research-intensive programs often require more time for students to complete their dissertations or theses.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **College of Health Professions - DH-BS (Dental Hygiene BS):** This program demonstrates very high completion rates (93.9% at 100%, 150%, and 200%). This suggests a well-structured program with strong student support.
*   **College of Public Health - PH-MPH (Public Health MPH):** This program has a very low 100% completion rate (3.2%), but a significantly higher rate at 200% (64.5%). This indicates that many students are taking longer than the standard time to complete the degree.
*   **Graduate School - NS-PHD (Nursing Science PhD):** This program has a 0% completion rate at 100% of the standard time and only 25% at 200% of the standard time. This suggests significant challenges for students in this program.
*   **College of Medicine - COM-MD (Medicine MD):** This program has a high completion rate (85% at 100%, 95.4% at 150%, and 97.1% at 200%). This suggests a well-structured program with strong student support.

## 4. Conclusions

The data provides valuable insights into program completion rates and potential factors influencing student success. Key conclusions include:

*   Completion rates are highly variable across programs and degree levels.
*   Certificate programs generally have higher on-time completion rates than degree programs.
*   PhD programs often have lower on-time completion rates, but many students eventually complete the program within an extended timeframe.
*   Programs with consistently low completion rates warrant further investigation to identify and address potential barriers to student success.
*   Further research is needed to explore the reasons behind the observed differences in completion rates and to develop strategies for improving student outcomes. This could include qualitative data gathering, such as student surveys and interviews, to understand the challenges they face.
