# Web Scraper Modularization Guide

## Why Modularize?

The original `web_scraper.py` file had grown to thousands of lines of code, making it difficult to:

1. **Maintain**: Bug fixes and feature additions required navigating a large, complex file
2. **Understand**: New developers had to comprehend the entire file to make changes
3. **Test**: Testing specific functionality was challenging
4. **Extend**: Adding new search engines or features required modifying the monolithic file
5. **Reuse**: Using only specific parts of the functionality was not straightforward

## Modular Structure

The new modular structure organizes the code into logical components:

```
web_scraper/
├── __init__.py                 # Main package module
├── browser/                    # Browser management
│   └── __init__.py
├── captcha/                    # CAPTCHA detection and handling
│   └── __init__.py
├── config/                     # Configuration settings
│   └── __init__.py
├── exceptions/                 # Custom exceptions
│   └── __init__.py
├── search_engines/             # Search engine modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── google_scholar.py
│   └── research_gate.py
└── utils/                      # Utility functions
    └── __init__.py
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear responsibility
2. **Better Organization**: Code is organized by functionality
3. **Enhanced Extensibility**: New search engines can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Easier Testing**: Modules can be tested independently
5. **Better Documentation**: Each module has its own documentation
6. **Simplified Imports**: Only import what you need

## Migration Process

To migrate from the old monolithic structure to the new modular structure:

1. Run the migration script:
   ```
   python migrate_to_modular.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Create a backup of your original `web_scraper.py` file
   - Replace it with a compatibility wrapper that imports from the new package
   - Ensure your existing code continues to work during the transition

3. Update your imports to use the new modular structure directly:
   ```python
   # Old way (still works with the compatibility wrapper)
   from web_scraper import search_academic_databases

   # New way (recommended)
   from web_scraper import search_academic_databases
   ```

## Using the New Modular Structure

### Basic Usage

The main functionality remains the same:

```python
from web_scraper import search_academic_databases

# Simple search with a list of topics
topics = ["machine learning", "artificial intelligence"]
results = search_academic_databases(topics)
```

### Advanced Usage

You can now import specific components as needed:

```python
# Import only what you need
from web_scraper.browser import setup_browser
from web_scraper.utils import download_pdf, extract_text_from_pdf

# Set up a browser
browser = setup_browser(headless=False, browser_type="firefox")

# Download and process a PDF
pdf_content = download_pdf("https://example.com/paper.pdf")
text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_content)
```

### Adding a New Search Engine

One of the biggest advantages of the new structure is the ability to easily add new search engines:

1. Create a new file in the `search_engines` directory (e.g., `web_scraper/search_engines/arxiv.py`)
2. Implement the search function:
   ```python
   def search_arxiv(browser, search_term, settings=None):
       # Implementation here
       return results
   ```
3. Register the function in `search_engines/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   from .arxiv import search_arxiv
   
   ENGINE_FUNCTIONS = {
       'google_scholar': search_google_scholar,
       'research_gate': search_research_gate,
       'arxiv': search_arxiv,  # Add the new engine
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you encounter import errors after migration:

1. Ensure the `web_scraper` package is in your Python path
2. Check that all required dependencies are installed
3. Verify that the compatibility wrapper is in place if you're still using the old imports

### Missing Functionality

If you find that some functionality from the original file is missing:

1. Check the appropriate module in the new structure
2. If it's genuinely missing, please report it as an issue
3. You can temporarily use the backed-up original file while the issue is resolved

## Contributing

Contributions to the modular web scraper are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Place new functionality in the appropriate module
2. Add proper documentation and type hints
3. Follow the existing code style
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update the README.md if necessary

## Future Improvements

The modularization is an ongoing process. Future improvements may include:

1. Adding more search engines
2. Improving error handling and recovery
3. Enhancing CAPTCHA detection and solving
4. Adding more utility functions for data processing
5. Creating a command-line interface
6. Implementing a plugin system for even more extensibility
