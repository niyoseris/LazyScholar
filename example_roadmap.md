## Methodology and Approach
### Research Design
- Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative population assessments with qualitative stakeholder interviews
- Comparative case studies of different regions within Cyprus
- Longitudinal monitoring of select cat colonies for population dynamics study
- GIS mapping of stray cat distributions and ecological impacts

### Data Collection Methods
- Field surveys using capture-mark-recapture techniques for population estimation
- Camera trapping for behavioral and predation studies
- Veterinary examinations and sampling for disease prevalence
- Questionnaires and interviews with local residents, tourists, and officials
- Document analysis of existing policies and management records

## Timeline and Milestones
### March 2025
- Complete literature review
- Develop research instruments and protocols
- Obtain necessary permits and ethical approvals

### April-June 2025
- Conduct field surveys in urban areas
- Begin stakeholder interviews
- Collect preliminary disease samples

### July-September 2025
- Extend field surveys to rural and coastal areas
- Continue stakeholder engagement
- Analyze initial data sets

### October-December 2025
- Complete all data collection
- Perform comparative analysis with international data
- Develop preliminary recommendations

### January-February 2026
- Finalize data analysis
- Draft research paper
- Prepare policy recommendations

## Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
- Access to accurate population data: Use multiple estimation methods and validate with expert consultations
- Seasonal variations affecting cat populations: Conduct surveys across multiple seasons to account for variation
- Public resistance to certain management strategies: Engage stakeholders early and incorporate their feedback
- Limited resources for wide-scale studies: Focus on representative sampling areas and leverage existing NGO networks
- Difficulty tracking feral cats: Employ both traditional and technological tracking methods (microchipping, GPS collars)

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive assessment of stray cat population dynamics in Cyprus
- Evidence-based evaluation of ecological and public health impacts
- Identification of culturally appropriate and effective management strategies
- Practical policy recommendations for sustainable population control
- Framework for ongoing monitoring and assessment
