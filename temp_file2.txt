            You are an academic citation expert. Convert the following source references into detailed academic citations in APA format.
            
            Topic: {topic}
            Subtopic: {subtopic}
            Sources: {sources}
            PDF Files: {pdf_files}
            
            For each source, create a proper academic citation. If the source is an arXiv paper, use the arXiv ID to infer the publication year.
            If author names are not available, use placeholder [Author, A. A.] and mark the citation as [inferred].
            If the title is not available, use a placeholder [Title of paper] based on the topic and subtopic, and mark the citation as [inferred].
