## Analysis of "Soil Survey in Cyprus" for Cypriot Terroir and Climate Research

**Topic:** Cypriot Terroir and Climate
**Subtopic:** Cyprus Soil Types

This analysis is based on the provided text from the paper "Soil Survey in Cyprus" by Costas Hadjiparaskevas.

### 1. Key Findings Related to Cyprus Soil Types

*   **Early Classification:** Initial soil classification (pre-1970) was based on formation, origin, and parent materials, categorizing soils as Red soils, sedentary soils, and alluvial/colluvial soils.
*   **FAO Adoption:** The FAO soil classification system was introduced in Cyprus in 1970 to establish a common international language in soil classification.
*   **Diagnostic Horizons:** The following diagnostic horizons derived from the FAO system have been adopted during soil surveys: Mollic, Ochric, Argillic, Natric, Cambic, Calcic and Gypsic.
*   **Soil Orders:** According to the FAO system, the following soil orders have been recognized: Lithosols, Regosols, Rendzinas, Solonchauks, Solonetz, Vertisols, Cambisols, and Luvisols.
*   **Two Major Categories:** Soils are broadly divided into deep soils (mainly in valley areas) and shallow soils (mountain and semi-mountain areas).
*   **Deep Soil Characteristics:** Deep soils can be heavy (high clay content), calcareous (high calcium carbonate), have high pH (7.5-8.6), low organic matter (<1%), and in some areas, high salt concentration.
*   **Shallow Soil Characteristics:** Shallow soils form on igneous rocks and calcareous sedimentary layers. Red Mediterranean soils on conglomerate are common in valley areas. Limitations include shallow depth, erosion, drainage problems, and high calcium carbonate.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Evolution of Soil Classification:** The shift from a formation/origin-based system to the FAO system reflects a move towards standardized, internationally recognized soil classification.
*   **Diagnostic Horizons and Soil Orders:** The identification of specific diagnostic horizons and soil orders provides a more detailed understanding of soil properties and their distribution across Cyprus.
*   **Soil Constraints:** The categorization of soils into deep and shallow types highlights the major limitations for agriculture, including texture, calcareousness, pH, organic matter content, salinity, depth, erosion, and drainage.
*   **Land Suitability:** The land suitability classification system (Classes I-V) demonstrates an understanding of how soil properties impact agricultural potential. The classification considers physical and chemical properties, soil depth, productivity, and reclamation costs.
*   **Climate Influence:** The paper mentions the low organic matter content in cultivated soils due to the hot climate and high mineralization rates, highlighting the interaction between climate and soil properties.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Red Mediterranean Soils:** The mention of "red Mediterranean soils on conglomerate" provides a specific example of a soil type found in valley areas.
*   **Land Use Map:** The reference to the Land Use of Cyprus map (1999) indicates an effort to spatially represent soil suitability and agricultural potential.

### 4. Conclusions

*   The soil survey in Cyprus has evolved from a basic classification system to a more detailed system based on FAO standards.
*   Cyprus has a variety of soil types, each with its own set of characteristics and limitations for agriculture.
*   Soil depth, texture, calcareousness, pH, organic matter content, and salinity are major constraints for agricultural productivity.
*   The land suitability classification system provides a framework for matching crops to appropriate soil types.
*   Climate plays a significant role in soil properties, particularly in organic matter content.
