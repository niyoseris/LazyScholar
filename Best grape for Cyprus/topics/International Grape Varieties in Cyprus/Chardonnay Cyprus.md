## Analysis of Wine List for Research on International Grape Varieties in Cyprus: Chardonnay

This analysis focuses on the provided wine list, specifically extracting information relevant to the topic of "International Grape Varieties in Cyprus" with the subtopic "Chardonnay Cyprus."

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Presence of Chardonnay in Cyprus:** The list includes one Cypriot Chardonnay: **Epos Kyperounda Chardonnay** from Limassol, priced at â‚¬49.
*   **International Chardonnay Representation:** The list features numerous international Chardonnays, primarily from France (Chablis, Burgundy, Champagne), but also from Italy.
*   **Chardonnay in Sparkling Wines:** Chardonnay is a key component in many sparkling wines on the list, including prestigious Champagnes like Moet et Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Taittinger, Louis Roederer, and Dom Perignon.
*   **Chardonnay Blends:** Some wines listed blend Chardonnay with other grape varieties, such as Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier in Champagne.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Limited Cypriot Chardonnay:** The wine list suggests that Chardonnay production in Cyprus, at least in the context of this particular selection, is limited. Only one Cypriot Chardonnay is listed, indicating it may not be a widely cultivated or prominently featured variety in the region.
*   **International Influence:** The extensive selection of international Chardonnays highlights the influence of global wine trends on the Cypriot market. Consumers in Cyprus (or at least at this establishment) have access to and presumably appreciate a diverse range of Chardonnay styles from around the world.
*   **Chardonnay's Role in Sparkling Wine:** The prominent use of Chardonnay in sparkling wines underscores its importance in this category. The presence of high-end Champagnes indicates a demand for premium sparkling wines in the Cypriot market.
*   **Potential for Growth:** While currently limited, the presence of a Cypriot Chardonnay suggests potential for further development and exploration of this variety within the Cypriot wine industry.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Epos Kyperounda Chardonnay:** This wine serves as a case study for Chardonnay cultivation and production in Cyprus. Further research could investigate the specific characteristics of this wine, the vineyard practices employed, and its reception among consumers.
*   **Comparison with International Chardonnays:** The list allows for a comparison of the Cypriot Chardonnay with international examples. This could be used to analyze differences in style, terroir expression, and pricing.

### 4. Conclusions

Based on this wine list, Chardonnay is present but not dominant in the Cypriot wine scene. The single listed Cypriot Chardonnay suggests a niche production, while the extensive selection of international Chardonnays indicates a consumer awareness and appreciation for the variety. Further research is needed to understand the full extent of Chardonnay cultivation in Cyprus, the characteristics of Cypriot Chardonnay wines, and their potential for future growth within the local wine industry. The Epos Kyperounda Chardonnay warrants further investigation as a specific example of Cypriot Chardonnay production.
