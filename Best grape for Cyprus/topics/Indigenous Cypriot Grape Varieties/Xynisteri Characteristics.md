## Indigenous Cypriot Grape Varieties: Xynisteri Characteristics - Analysis of Provided Text

### 1. Key Findings Related to Xynisteri

*   **Variety:** 98% Xynisteri (with 2% Malagardry White Wine blended in).
*   **Producer:** Tsiakkas Winery.
*   **Vintage:** 2019.
*   **Alcoholic Volume:** 11.85%.
*   **Tasting Characteristics:** Zesty citric aromas of peach and nectarine, with white flower tones. Crisp acidity and pleasant taste.
*   **Total Acidity:** 78.7 meq acetic acid/lt (This seems unusually high and may be a typo).
*   **Residual Sugar:** 1.9 gr/lt.
*   **Serving Temperature:** 12°C.
*   **Food Pairing:** Pairs well with white meat, poultry, fish, and green salads.
*   **Vineyard Location:** Organically farmed vineyards in Pitsilia, Cyprus.
*   **Vineyard Altitude:** Average altitude of 1200 meters (range 800-1400m).
*   **Soil:** Sandy, volcanic.
*   **Climate:** High diurnal shift mesoclimate. Cool breezes during the summer allow for good ripening.
*   **Harvest:** October.
*   **Vinification Methods:** Hand-picked grapes, two days of skin contact, fermentation with selected yeasts under strict temperature control. Ungrafted vines.
*   **P.G.I.:** Lemesos

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **High-Altitude Viticulture:** The high altitude of the vineyards (800-1400m) is a significant factor. This likely contributes to the "crisp acidity" mentioned in the tasting notes, as cooler temperatures at higher altitudes help retain acidity in the grapes during ripening.
*   **Diurnal Shift:** The "high diurnal shift mesoclimate" is also crucial. The large difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures further enhances acidity and aroma development in the Xynisteri grapes.
*   **Soil Influence:** The sandy, volcanic soil likely contributes to the wine's minerality and complexity.
*   **Winemaking Techniques:** The two days of skin contact before fermentation suggests an attempt to extract more flavor and texture from the Xynisteri grapes. The use of selected yeasts and strict temperature control during fermentation indicates a focus on producing a clean and consistent wine.
*   **Blend:** The 2% addition of Malagardry White Wine suggests an attempt to add complexity or balance to the Xynisteri.
*   **Food Pairing:** The suggested food pairings (white meat, poultry, fish, green salads) align with the typical characteristics of a dry, crisp white wine.
*   **Organic Farming:** The use of organically farmed vineyards is a positive aspect, suggesting a commitment to sustainable viticulture.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The text provides a case study of Tsiakkas Winery's 2019 Xynisteri. It showcases how the winery utilizes specific vineyard locations, climate conditions, and winemaking techniques to produce a Xynisteri wine with particular characteristics.

### 4. Conclusions

The provided text offers valuable insights into the characteristics of Xynisteri, particularly when grown in the Pitsilia region of Cyprus. The high-altitude vineyards, diurnal temperature variations, and sandy, volcanic soils appear to play a significant role in shaping the grape's profile, contributing to its crisp acidity and aromatic complexity. Tsiakkas Winery's approach, including skin contact and controlled fermentation, further influences the final product. The information suggests that Xynisteri from this region has the potential to produce high-quality, distinctive white wines.

## Indigenous Cypriot Grape Varieties: Xynisteri Characteristics - Analysis of Provided Text

### 1. Key Findings Related to Xynisteri

*   **Variety Composition:** The wine analyzed is 98% Xynisteri, blended with 2% Malagadri white wine.
*   **Vintage:** 2019
*   **Producer:** Tsiakkas Winery
*   **Region:** Pitsilia, Cyprus (P.G.I. Lemesos)
*   **Vineyard Characteristics:** Organically farmed, ungrafted vines at high altitude (800-1400m, average 1200m). Sandy, volcanic soil.
*   **Vinification:** Hand-picked grapes, two days of skin contact, fermentation with selected yeasts under strict temperature control. Harvested in October.
*   **Alcohol Content:** 11.85%
*   **Tasting Characteristics:** Zesty citric aromas of peach and nectarine, with white flower tones. Crisp acidity and pleasant taste.
*   **Serving Suggestions:** Pairs well with white meat, poultry, fish, and green salads. Serve at 12°C.
*   **Residual Sugar:** 1.9 gr/lt
*   **Total Acidity:** 78.7 meq acetic acid/lt

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **High-Altitude Viticulture:** The high altitude of the vineyards (800-1400m) is a significant factor. High altitude viticulture often leads to grapes with higher acidity due to cooler temperatures and a longer ripening period. This aligns with the "crisp acidity" noted in the tasting characteristics.
*   **Soil Influence:** The sandy, volcanic soil likely contributes to the wine's flavor profile. Volcanic soils are often associated with minerality in wines.
*   **Diurnal Shift:** The "high diurnal shift mesoclimate" is crucial. Large temperature differences between day and night promote balanced ripening, contributing to both sugar accumulation and acid retention.
*   **Winemaking Techniques:** The two days of skin contact likely contribute to the wine's aromatic complexity and potentially a slightly fuller body. The use of selected yeasts and strict temperature control during fermentation indicates a focus on preserving the varietal characteristics of Xynisteri.
*   **Organic Farming:** The organic farming practices suggest a commitment to sustainability and potentially a more terroir-driven expression of the Xynisteri grape.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   This text provides a case study of a specific Xynisteri wine produced by Tsiakkas Winery in 2019. It showcases the characteristics of Xynisteri grown in the Pitsilia region under specific vineyard management and winemaking practices.

### 4. Conclusions

The provided text offers valuable insights into the characteristics of Xynisteri. It highlights the importance of terroir (high altitude, sandy volcanic soil, diurnal shift) and winemaking techniques in shaping the wine's profile. The wine is characterized by crisp acidity, citrus and stone fruit aromas, and is well-suited to pairing with a variety of foods. The information suggests that Xynisteri, when grown in the Pitsilia region and carefully vinified, can produce a refreshing and flavorful white wine.
