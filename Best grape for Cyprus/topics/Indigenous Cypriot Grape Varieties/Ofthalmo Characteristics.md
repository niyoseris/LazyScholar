# Indigenous Cypriot Grape Varieties: Ofthalmo Characteristics

This analysis is based on the provided text from Nelion Winery's website.

## 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Variety:** The wine is made from 100% Ofthalmo grapes.
*   **Type:** It's a dry red wine.
*   **Harvest:** The grapes are harvested in late August to early September.
*   **Vineyards:** The Ofthalmo grapes are grown in two vineyards at altitudes of 600 and 800 meters.
*   **Vine Training:** The vines are trained in a goblet (cup-shaped) style.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Pure Varietal Wine:** The wine being 100% Ofthalmo indicates a focus on showcasing the unique characteristics of this indigenous Cypriot grape.
*   **Altitude Influence:** The vineyards' high altitude (600-800m) suggests that the grapes may experience cooler temperatures, potentially leading to higher acidity and more complex aromas in the wine.
*   **Traditional Vine Training:** The goblet vine training system is a traditional method, often used in warmer climates. This suggests a possible adaptation to the Cypriot climate.
*   **Winemaking Techniques:** The use of *pigeage* (punching down the cap) during maceration indicates a desire to extract color, tannins, and flavor from the grape skins. The removal of seeds (γίγαρτα) after 7 days suggests an attempt to reduce bitterness.
*   **Oak Aging:** The 12-month aging in French oak barrels suggests an intention to add complexity, structure, and potentially vanilla or spice notes to the wine.
*   **Time to Market:** Bottling 18 months after harvest indicates a relatively long aging process for this wine.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   This text serves as a case study of Nelion Winery's production of a 100% Ofthalmo wine. It provides specific details about their viticultural and winemaking practices.

## 4. Conclusions

The provided text, while limited, offers valuable insights into the characteristics of Ofthalmo grapes and the production of wine made from them. It highlights the use of traditional viticultural practices, specific winemaking techniques, and the importance of altitude in shaping the final product. The information suggests that Ofthalmo is being treated as a grape variety worthy of showcasing on its own, with winemaking choices geared towards extracting its unique qualities. Further research would be needed to compare this example with other producers of Ofthalmo and to understand the broader characteristics of the variety across different regions and winemaking styles.


# Indigenous Cypriot Grape Varieties: Ofthalmo Characteristics

This analysis is based on the provided text from Nelion Winery's website, focusing on the Ofthalmo variety.

## 1. Key Findings Related to Ofthalmo

*   **Variety Composition:** The wine is 100% Ofthalmo.
*   **Harvest Time:** Late August to early September.
*   **Vineyard Location:** Two vineyards at altitudes of 600 and 800 meters.
*   **Vine Training:** Vines are trained in a goblet (cup-shaped) style.
*   **Winemaking:**
    *   Grapes are destemmed and lightly crushed.
    *   Pigeage (punching down the cap) is used during maceration.
    *   Maceration lasts for 16 days.
    *   Seeds (presumably grape seeds) are removed after 7 days.
    *   The wine is aged for 12 months in French oak barrels.
    *   Bottling occurs 18 months after harvest.
*   **Wine Type:** Red, dry wine.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Altitude Influence:** The mention of vineyards at 600 and 800 meters suggests that altitude plays a role in the characteristics of the Ofthalmo grapes and the resulting wine. Higher altitudes often lead to cooler temperatures, which can affect acidity, aroma development, and overall grape ripening.
*   **Traditional Winemaking:** The use of goblet-shaped vine training and pigeage indicates a blend of traditional and modern winemaking techniques. Goblet training is a traditional method suited to drier climates.
*   **Oak Aging:** The 12-month aging in French oak barrels suggests an intention to add complexity, structure, and potentially vanilla or spice notes to the wine.
*   **Maceration Length:** The 16-day maceration period is relatively long, suggesting a desire to extract significant color, tannins, and flavor compounds from the grape skins.
*   **Seed Removal:** Removing the seeds after 7 days is interesting. It could be to reduce bitterness or astringency in the final wine.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The entire text serves as a case study of Nelion Winery's approach to producing wine from the Ofthalmo variety. It provides specific details about their viticultural and winemaking practices.

## 4. Conclusions

The provided text offers valuable insights into the characteristics of the Ofthalmo grape variety and its use in winemaking by Nelion Winery. It highlights the importance of altitude, traditional vine training methods, and oak aging in shaping the final product. The information suggests that Ofthalmo is capable of producing a complex and structured red wine. Further research, including sensory analysis of the wine, would be needed to fully understand the unique characteristics of this indigenous Cypriot grape variety.
