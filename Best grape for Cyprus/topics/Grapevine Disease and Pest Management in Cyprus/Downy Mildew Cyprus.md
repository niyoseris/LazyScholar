# Grapevine Disease and Pest Management in Cyprus: Downy Mildew

## 1. Key Findings Related to Downy Mildew

*   Downy mildews are pathogenic water molds causing leaf spots, blights, and distortions.
*   Symptoms vary significantly between hosts, making diagnosis difficult.
*   Sporulation occurs on the underside of lesions, appearing as grayish downy growth.
*   Cool, wet conditions (50-75Â°F, >85% humidity) favor downy mildew outbreaks.
*   The disease cycle is typically 7-10 days but can be shorter under humid conditions.
*   Some downy mildews can infect plants systemically.

## 2. Analysis and Insights

*   Understanding the disease cycle is crucial for management.
*   Cultural practices to reduce humidity (pruning, spacing) can help prevent or decrease severity.
*   Sanitation (clean stock, removing infected plants) is essential.
*   Preventative fungicide applications are more effective than curative ones.
*   Rotating fungicides with different modes of action is important to prevent resistance.

## 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   Impatiens downy mildew (Plasmopara obducens) only infects impatiens.
*   Sunflower downy mildew (Plasmopara halstedii) infects members of the daisy family.
*   Impatiens: Resistant cultivars (Imara, Beacon series, New Guinea impatiens) have been identified.

## 4. Conclusions

*   Effective downy mildew management requires an integrated approach.
*   This approach includes cultural practices, sanitation, and preventative fungicide applications.
*   Understanding the disease cycle and host susceptibility is critical for successful management.
*   Fungicide resistance is a concern, necessitating rotation of products with different modes of action.
