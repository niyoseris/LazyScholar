## Grapevine Disease and Pest Management in Cyprus: Pest Control in Vineyards

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Grape Berry Moth (Lobesia botrana) is a major pest:** The study identifies the grape berry moth as the most important insect pest attacking grapes in Cyprus.
*   **Spray Technology and Volume Rate Impact Pest Control:** The research evaluates the effectiveness of different spray technologies (spray gun vs. orchard sprayer) and volume rates (1000 L/ha, 500 L/ha, and 250 L/ha) on controlling the grape berry moth.
*   **Lower Volume Rates Can Be Effective:** The study suggests that reducing application volume and pesticide amount by 50% or more can provide adequate control of the grape berry moth in some cases.
*   **Infestation Levels:** Infestation by the grape berry moth varied from about 2.5% for Palomino, to 8% for Carignan and 3.2% for Xynisteri. Infestation in sprayed plots remained below 1.8% for all treatments, varieties and study years.
*   **Coverage vs. Control:** While coverage values are considered adequate for pest control, no direct relationship with insect control effectiveness has been demonstrated yet.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Pesticide Reduction is Possible:** The research indicates that it's possible to reduce pesticide use in Cypriot vineyards without significantly compromising pest control. This aligns with EU's Farm to Fork Strategy.
*   **Mountain Viticulture Challenges:** The study acknowledges the specific challenges of mountain viticulture in Cyprus, such as limited water availability and difficult terrain, which make lower volume spraying a more practical option.
*   **Spray Coverage is Important:** The study highlights the importance of spray coverage, with the high-volume sprayer achieving significantly higher coverage compared to the orchard sprayers at lower volume rates. However, the pest control effectiveness was not always directly proportional to the coverage.
*   **Variety Matters:** The natural infestation rates varied significantly across grape varieties, suggesting that pest management strategies might need to be tailored to specific varieties.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   **Three Grape Varieties Studied:** The study was conducted on three different grape varieties (Palomino, Carignan, and Xynisteri) in mountain vineyards in Cyprus.
*   **Two-Year Experiment:** The experiments were carried out over two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) to account for variations in environmental conditions and pest pressure.
*   **Spray Technologies Compared:** The study compared a traditional high-volume sprayer (spray gun) with conventional orchard sprayers at two different volume rates.

### 4. Conclusions

*   **Potential for Sustainable Pest Management:** The study concludes that lowering application volume and pesticide amount can be an effective option for reducing pesticide use in vineyards, contributing to more sustainable pest management practices.
*   **Further Research Needed:** The study suggests the need for further research to establish a clear relationship between spray coverage and insect control effectiveness.
*   **Context-Specific Solutions:** The findings emphasize the importance of considering the specific context of mountain viticulture in Cyprus when developing pest management strategies.

## Grapevine Disease and Pest Management in Cyprus: Pest Control in Vineyards

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   The study evaluated the effectiveness of different spray technologies and volume rates in controlling the grape berry moth ( *Lobesia botrana* ) in mountain vineyards in Cyprus.
*   Two spray technologies were compared: a high-volume sprayer (HVS) using a spray gun at 1000 L/ha and a conventional orchard sprayer (OS) at 500 L/ha (OS500) and 250 L/ha (OS250).
*   Infestation levels in sprayed plots remained below 1.8% for all treatments, varieties, and study years.
*   The study suggests that reducing application volume and pesticide amount by 50% or more can provide adequate control of the grape berry moth.
*   The median coverage for HVS remained above 80% for all three varieties, while that for OS500 ranged from 26% to 56%, and that for OS250 from 18% to 37%.
*   Infestation by the grape berry moth varied from about 2.5% for Palomino, to 8% for Carignan and 3.2% for Xynisteri.
*   Although infestation levels in OS250 were not different than the control in two varieties, the infestation levels among sprayer treatments did not differ by more than one percentage point.

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   The research addresses the need to reduce pesticide use in viticulture, driven by public concerns and EU policies like the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive.
*   Mountain viticulture in Cyprus faces challenges in water availability and transport, making volume reduction particularly important.
*   The study highlights the potential of modern pesticide technologies, such as orchard sprayers, to lower volume rates and reduce pesticide use without significantly compromising pest control.
*   The findings suggest that lower spray volumes can be effective, offering environmental, human health, and financial benefits.
*   The research acknowledges the importance of correct calibration of agricultural machinery to reduce pesticide use.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The study was conducted in three different vineyards in Cyprus over two years (2017 and 2018), using three grape varieties: Palomino, Carignan, and Xynisteri.
*   The study compared three treatments: HVS (1000 L/ha), OS500 (500 L/ha), and OS250 (250 L/ha), along with a control group.
*   The experiments were carried out at two representative crop stages: BBCH 65 and BBCH 85.

### 4. Conclusions

*   Lowering application volume and pesticide amount to 50% or more can provide adequate control of the grape berry moth in some cases, representing an effective option for reducing pesticide use in vineyards.
*   The study supports the adoption of modern pesticide technologies and optimized spray strategies to achieve sustainable pest management in mountain viticulture in Cyprus.

## Grapevine Disease and Pest Management in Cyprus: Pest Control in Cyprus Vineyards - Analysis of Provided Text

This analysis focuses on extracting information relevant to the topic of grapevine disease and pest management in Cyprus, specifically addressing pest control in Cyprus vineyards, from the provided text.  It's important to note that the provided text is from Michigan State University Extension, and therefore directly applicable to Cyprus. However, the principles and strategies discussed can be adapted.

### 1. Key Findings Related to the Topic and Subtopic

*   **Focus on Small Vineyards:** The document specifically addresses pest control challenges in small vineyards, acknowledging the limited choice of materials and the high cost of some products for smaller operations.
*   **Common Pests:** The document identifies common insect and disease pests in temperate-climate vineyards. While the specific pests may differ in Cyprus, the approach to identification and control is relevant.
*   **Importance of Identification:**  The document stresses that effective pest control begins with accurate identification of the pests affecting the vines.
*   **Disclaimer:** The document emphasizes the importance of checking for current registration status and alternative spray programs with the local county extension office. This highlights the dynamic nature of pesticide regulations and the need for localized advice.
