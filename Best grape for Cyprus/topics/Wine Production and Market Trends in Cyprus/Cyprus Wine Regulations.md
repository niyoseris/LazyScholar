*   **Definition of Cyprus Wine:** Defined as wine produced in Cyprus from grapes grown in Cyprus.
*   **Regulation of Sales and Exports:** Prohibits the sale, exposure for sale, or export of Cyprus wine under specific appellations unless the wine meets the descriptions and conditions outlined in the Schedule.
*   **Appellation Marks:** Mandates appellation marks on exported Cyprus wine to countries designated by the Governor.
*   **Offences and Penalties:** Specifies penalties (imprisonment or fines) for falsely using appellations or violating the law's provisions. Forfeiture of the wine can also be ordered.
*   **Regulatory Powers:** Grants the Governor in Council the power to make regulations, including appointing inspectors, testing wines, and seizing wines that violate the law.
*   **Specific Wine Categories:** Defines specific categories of Cyprus wine, including Cyprus Dry Wine, Cyprus Demi-Sec Wine, Cyprus Sweet Wine, Cyprus Commandaria, Cyprus Muscatel Wine, Cyprus Sherry, and Cyprus Mistella, with detailed descriptions of their characteristics (color, sweetness, alcoholic strength).

### 2. Analysis and Insights

*   **Early Focus on Quality Control:** The law demonstrates an early recognition of the importance of protecting the reputation and quality of Cyprus wines through appellation control.
*   **Emphasis on Export Markets:** The inclusion of provisions for appellation marks on exported wines suggests a focus on maintaining standards in international markets.

*   **Blending Restrictions:** The law allows for blending with other wine, juice, or alcohol, but limits it to 10% by volume. This suggests a balance between maintaining authenticity and allowing for some flexibility in production.

### 3. Examples or Case Studies

*   The document itself is the case study. It is the legal framework established to regulate Cyprus wine production and protect its appellations.
*   The Schedule provides specific examples of wine categories and their required characteristics. For example, Cyprus Commandaria is defined as a special wine produced from over-ripe or half-dried grapes with specific sweetness and alcoholic strength requirements.

### 4. Conclusions

The "Appellation (Cyprus Wines) Protection Law, 1950" represents a significant step in the development of Cyprus wine regulations.
